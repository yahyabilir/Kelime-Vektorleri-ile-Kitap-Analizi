DUDLEY DEMENTED 

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to 
a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square 
houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually 
gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that 
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; 
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to 
drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and 
lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive 
had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, 
windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a 
nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was 
a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a 
flower bed outside number four. 

He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who 
had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone 
who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His 
jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and 
faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away 
from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not 
endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of 
people who thought scruffiness ought to be

punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself 
behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was 
quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he 
would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt 
Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room 
window and looked straight down into the flower bed 
below. 

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be 
congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, 
perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard 
earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not 
hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as 
had happened every time he had tried sitting down in 
the living room and watching television with his aunt 
and uncle. 

Almost as though this thought had fluttered through 
the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, 
suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the boy’s stopped trying 
to butt in. Where is he anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not 
in the house.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted. 

“Watching the news ...” he said scathingly. “I’d like to 
know what he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares 
what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s 
going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! 
Anyway, it’s not as if there ’d be anything about his lot 
on our news — ” 

“Vernon, shh\” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s 
open!” 

“Oh — yes — sorry, dear ...” 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle 
about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched 
Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby 
Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning 
and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that 
he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had 
recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever 
she met him in the street. She had rounded the 
corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of the window again. 

“Dudders out for tea?” 

“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got 
so many little friends, he’s so popular ...” 

Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys 
really were astonishingly stupid about their son, 
Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies 
about having tea with a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew 
perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea 
anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening 
vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, 
and throwing stones at passing cars and children. 
Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks 
around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the 
holidays wandering the streets, scavenging 
newspapers from bins along the way. 

The opening notes of the music that heralded the 
seven o’clock news reached Harry’s ears and his 
stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight — after a 
month of waiting — would be the night — 

“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill 
airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike 
reaches its second week — ” 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle 
Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence, 
but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s 
stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had 
happened, it would surely have been the first item on 
the news; death and destruction were more important 
than stranded holidaymakers... 

He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the 
brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been 
the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary 
relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the 
question of why nothing had happened yet... 

He kept listening, just in case there was some small 
clue, not recognized for what it really was by the 
Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, 
perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the 
drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next 
door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on 
at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had 
almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous 
actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if 
we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt 
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in 
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 

Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening 
sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the 
budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this 
summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in 
Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins 
went to find out more...” 

Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached 
water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else 
worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing 
to crawl out from under the window. 

He had moved about two inches when several things 
happened in very quick succession. 

A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a 
gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car 
and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and 
the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ 
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting 
for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time 
pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden 
wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before 
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his 
head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and 
the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even 
louder. 

Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes 
streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street 
and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely 
staggered upright again when two large purple hands 
reached through the open window and closed tightly 
around his throat. 

“Put — it — away\” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s 
ear. “Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” 

“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds 
they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- 
like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a 
firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the 
top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, 
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he 
had received an electric shock — some invisible force 
seemed to have surged through his nephew, making 
him impossible to hold. 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, 
straightened up, and stared around. There was no 
sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but 
there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back 
into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 

“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at 
Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her 
net curtains. “Did you hear that car backfire just 
now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 

He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all 
the curious neighbors had disappeared from their 
various windows, then the grin became a grimace of 
rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 

Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop 
just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon’s 
outstretched hands could resume their strangling. 

“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle 
Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. 

“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept 
looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see 
the person who had made the cracking noise. 

“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside 
our — ” 

“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly. 

Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside 
Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 

“Why were you lurking under our window?” 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing 
under our window, boy?” 

“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned 
voice. 

His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 

“Listening to the news! Again?” 

“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry. 

“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know 
what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any 
more of this listening to the news tosh! You know 
perfectly well that your lot ...” 

“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle 
Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely 
hear him, "... that your lot don’t get on our news!” 

“That’s all you know,” said Harry. 

The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then 
Aunt Petunia said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are 
all those — ” she too lowered her voice so that Harry 
had to lip-read the next word, “ — owls — doing if 
they’re not bringing you news?” 

“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 
“Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get 
all your news from those pestilential birds!” 

Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something 
to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and 
uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at 
admitting it. 



Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The owls ... aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry 
tonelessly. 

“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once. 

“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon. 

“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper 
rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, 
he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, 
stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off 
up the street. 

He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have 
to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for 
his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at 
the moment; he had much more pressing matters on 
his mind. 

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been 
made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It 
was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made 
when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be 
following him right at this very moment? As this 
thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back 
down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely 
deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did 
not know how to become invisible... 

He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was 
taking, for he had pounded these streets so often 
lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts 
automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as 
he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was 
sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to him, why hadn’t 
they made contact, why were they hiding now? 

And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his 
certainty leaked away. 

Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. 
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of 
contact from the world to which he belonged that he 
was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of 
something breaking inside a neighbor’s house? 

Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach 
and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness 
that had plagued him all summer rolled over him 
once again... 

Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm 
at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that 
delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point 
in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the 
front page before throwing it aside these days; when 
the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that 
Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and 
that was the only kind Harry cared about. 

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying 
letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, 
though any expectation he had had that their letters 
would bring him news had long since been dashed. 

“We can’t say much about you-know-what, 
obviously...” “We’ve been told not to say anything 
important in case our letters go astray...” “We’re quite 
busy but I can’t give you details here...” “There’s a fair 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see 
you...” 

But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed 
too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had 
scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” 
inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As 
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their 
letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, 
presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. He could hardly 
bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he 
was so angry at them that he had thrown both their 
birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away 
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for 
dinner that night. 

And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why 
wasn’t he, Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself 
capable of handling much more than they? Had they 
all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it been he who 
had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly 
killed ... ? 

Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for 
the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough 
that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his 
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking 
moments too. 

He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway 
along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of 
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his 
godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how 
Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as 
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




least they contained words of caution and consolation 
instead of tantalizing hints: 

“ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your 
nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful 
and don’t do anything rash...” 

Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia 
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed 
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) 
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the 
temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set 
off for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought 
his behavior had been very good considering how 
frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in 
the hope of hearing something that might point to 
what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was 
quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who 
had served twelve years in the wizard prison, 

Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder 
he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone 
on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . 

Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off 
across the parched grass. The park was as empty as 
the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings 
he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends 
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He 
would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed 
again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some 
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, 
he had nothing to look forward to but another 
restless, disturbed night, because even when he 
escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling 
dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in 
dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had 
something to do with the trapped feeling he had when 
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead 
prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself 
that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very 
interesting anymore... In the past his scar hurting 
had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger 
again, but now that Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was 
only to be expected... Nothing to worry about ... old 
news ... 

The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he 
wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, 
nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for 
four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical 
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so 
that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? 
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he 
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and 
be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the 
stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort 
had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around 
in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with anger as 
a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of 
the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that 
of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the 
park railings. 

He did not know how long he had sat on the swing 
before the sound of voices interrupted his musings 
and he looked up. The street-lamps from the 
surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their 
way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, 
crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking 
noise came from several expensive racing bikes that 
they were wheeling along. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front 
was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, 
wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful 
gang. 

Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting 
and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a 
change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly 
told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently 
become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing 
Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as 
Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more 
formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the 
primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s 
first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of 
his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that 
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately 
was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified 
than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had 
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended 
St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 

Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass 
and wondered whom they had been beating up 
tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as 
he watched them. Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting 
here all alone... Come and have ago... 

If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would 
be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would 
Dudley do then? He wouldn’t want to lose face in 
front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking 
Harry. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s 
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him 
powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried 
hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand . . . 
let them try ... He’d love to vent some of his 
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




frustration on the boys who had once made his life 
hell — 



But they did not turn around, they did not see him, 
they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the 
impulse to call after them... Seeking a fight was not a 
smart move... He must not use magic... He would be 
risking expulsion again... 

Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, 
heading along Magnolia Road. 

There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing 
rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what 
you’d have done ... 

He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and 
Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley 
turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime 
after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home 
after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, 
Harry set off toward the park gate. 

Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, 
square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all 
owned by large, square owners who drove very clean 
cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred Little 
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows 
made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness 
and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving 
mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that 
halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into 
view again; they were saying their farewells at the 
entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into 
the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




"... squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was 
saying, to guffaws from the others. 

“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. 

“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said 
Gordon. 

“See you then,” said Dudley. 

“Bye Dud!” 

“See ya, Big D!” 

Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on 
before setting off again. When their voices had faded 
once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia 
Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came 
within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling 
along at his ease, humming tunelessly. 

“Hey, Big D!” 

Dudley turned. 

“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” 

“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 

“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. 

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into 
step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle 
Diddykins to me.” 

“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands 
had curled into fists. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls 
you?” 

“Shut your face.” 

“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about 
‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them 
then?” 

Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself 
from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his 
self-control. 

“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry 
asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know 
you did Mark Evans two nights ago — ” 

“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. 

“Oh yeah?” 

“He cheeked me.” 

“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been 
taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not 
cheek, Dud, that’s true ...” 

A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry 
enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was 
making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning 
off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet 
he had. 

They turned right down the narrow alleyway where 
Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a 
shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria 
Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets 
it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one 
side and a high fence on the other. 

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t 
you?” Dudley said after a few seconds. 

“What thing?” 

“That — that thing you’re hiding.” 

Harry grinned again. 

“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose 
if you were, you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at 
the same time...” 

Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look 
sideways at it. 

“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know 
you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school 
you go to.” 

“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big 
D?” 

“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound 
completely convinced. Harry laughed softly. 

“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that 
thing, have you?” Dudley snarled. 

“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before 
you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing 
title you keep banging on about? How old was your 
opponent? Seven? Eight?” 

“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled 
Dudley, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as 
you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out — ” 

“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing 
champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 

“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. 

“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when 
it goes all dark like this.” 

“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 

He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at 
his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley’s 
large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant 
look. 

“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, 
completely nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be 
frightened of pillows or something?” 

“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. 
“Talking in your sleep. Moaning.” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was 
a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had 
revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams. 

Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a 
high-pitched, whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! 
Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” 

“I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically. But his 
mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — 
how else would he know about Cedric? 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ T)ad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo- 
hoo!”’ 

“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m 
warning you!” 

“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! 
He’s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to — ’ 
Don’t you point that thing at me\” 

Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing 
the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel 
fourteen years’ hatred of Dudley pounding in his 
veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to jinx 
Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an 
insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — 

“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. 
“D’you understand me?” 

“Point that thing somewhere else!” 

“I said, do you understand me?” 

“Point it somewhere else\” 

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 

“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM — ” 

Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he 
had been doused in icy water. 

Something had happened to the night. The star- 
strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and 
lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps 
at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. 

The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, 
silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, 
blinding them. 

For a split second Harry thought he had done magic 
without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been 
resisting as hard as he could — then his reason 
caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power 
to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and 
that, trying to see something, but the darkness 
pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil. 

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear. 

“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 

“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 

“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I — ” 

“I said shut up!” 

Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left 
and right. The cold was so intense that he was 
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his 
arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were 
standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest 
extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . . 

It was impossible... They couldn’t be here... Not in 
Little Whinging ... He strained his ears... He would 
hear them before he saw them... 

“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? 
What are you d-do — ?” 

“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis — ” 



Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had 
been dreading. 



There was something in the alleyway apart from 
themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, 
rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as 
he stood trembling in the freezing air. 

“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I 
will!” 

“Dudley, shut — ” 

WHAM 

A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, 
lifting Harry off his feet. Small white lights popped in 
front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour 
he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; 
next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and 
his wand had flown out of his hand. 

“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering 
with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, 
now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He 
heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, 
stumbling. 

“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT 
AT IT!” 

There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s 
footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a 
creeping chill behind him that could mean only one 
thing. There was more than one. 

“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER 
YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground 
like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on — Lumosl” 

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to 
help him in his search — and to his disbelieving 
relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the 
wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, 
scrambled to his feet, and turned around. 

His stomach turned over. 

A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly 
toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face 
visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it 
came. 

Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 

“Expecto Patronurrd” 

A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand 
and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked 
properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated 
farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic 
fogging his brain — concentrate — 

A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside 
the dementor’s robes, reaching for him. A rushing 
noise filled Harry’s ears. 

“Expecto PatronumV’ 

His voice sounded dim and distant... Another wisp of 
silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the 
wand — he couldn’t do it anymore, he couldn’t work 
the spell — 

There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high- 
pitched laughter... He could smell the dementor’s 

Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, 
drowning him — Think ... something happy... 

But there was no happiness in him... The dementor’s 
icy fingers were closing on his throat — the high- 
pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and 
a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death, 

Harry. . . It might even be painless. . . I would not 
know... I have never died...” 

He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again — 

And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he 
fought for breath — 

“EXPECTO PATRONUM” 

An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of 
Harry’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the 
place where the heart should have been; it was 
thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the 
stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike 
and defeated. 

“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling 
around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit 
wand aloft. “DUDLEY? DUDLEY!” 

He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached 
them: Dudley was curled on the ground, his arms 
clamped over his face; a second dementor was 
crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its 
slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly 
apart, lowering its hooded head toward Dudley’s face 
as though about to kiss him... 

“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring 
sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping 
back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was 

Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver antlers 
caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, 
like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into 
the darkness. The stag cantered to the end of the 
alleyway and dissolved into silver mist. 

Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A 
warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in 
neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars 
in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry stood 
quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the 
abrupt return to normality. After a moment he 
became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he 
was drenched in sweat. 

He could not believe what had just happened. 
Dementors here, in Little Whinging . . . 

Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and 
shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a 
fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running 
footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand 
again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer. 

Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into 
sight. Her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its 
hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging 
from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out of her 
tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand 
hurriedly out of sight, but — 

“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if 
there are more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill 
Mundungus Fletcher!” 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 





A PECK OF OWLS 

“What?” said Harry blankly. 

“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to 
see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off 
the back of a broom! I told him I’d flay him alive if he 
went, and now look! Dementors! It’s just lucky I put 
Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to 
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! 
Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!” 

“But — ” 

The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed 
neighbor knew what dementors were was almost as 
big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the 
alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?” 

“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how 
on earth was I supposed to help you fight off 
dementors? He left you completely without cover 
when I warned him — ” 



Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang 
on — it was him). He Disapparated from the front of 
my house!” 

“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies 
under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and 
warned me, but by the time I got to your house you’d 
gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to 
say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the 
alley floor. “Get your fat bottom off the ground, 
quick!” 

“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her. 

“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know 
Dumbledore? But come on — I’ll be no help if they 
come back, I’ve never so much as Transfigured a 
teabag — ” 

She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive 
arms in her wizened hands, and tugged. 

“Get up, you useless lump, get up!” 

But Dudley either could not or would not move. He 
was still on the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, 
his mouth shut very tight. 

“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and 
heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist 
Dudley to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point 
of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets 
and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let 
go of him he swayed dangerously. 

“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically. 

Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around 
his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, 

Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




sagging slightly under his weight. Mrs. Figg tottered 
along in front of them, peering anxiously around the 
corner. 

“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered 
Wisteria Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy 
now, there’s going to be hell to pay anyway, we might 
as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about 
the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery ... 
This was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — 
what’s that at the end of the street? Oh, it’s just Mr. 
Prentice... Don’t put your wand away, boy, don’t I 
keep telling you I’m no use?” 

It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry 
Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his cousin 
an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to 
have lost all desire for independent movement. He 
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet 
dragging along the ground. 

“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked 
Mrs. Figg, panting with the effort to keep walking. “All 
those times I came round your house — why didn’t 
you say anything?” 

“Dumbledore ’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you 
but not say anything, you were too young. I’m sorry I 
gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys 
would never have let you come if they’d thought you 
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know... But oh my 
word,” she said tragically, wringing her hands once 
more, “when Dumbledore hears about this — how 
could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be 
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I 
going to tell Dumbledore what’s happened, I can’t 
Apparate — ” 



Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, 
wondering whether his spine was going to snap under 
Dudley’s weight. 

“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need 
to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry have their 
own ways of detecting underage magic, they’ll know 
already, you mark my words — ” 

“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use 
magic — they’re going to be more worried what 
dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, 
surely?” 

“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — 
MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL 
YOU!” 

There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled 
drink and stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, 
unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized 
right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long 
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that 
gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was 
also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognized 
at once as an Invisibility Cloak. 

“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to 
Harry and Dudley. “What ’appened to staying 
undercover?” 

“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, 
you useless, skiving sneak thief!” 

“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. 
“Dementors here?” 



Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” 
shrieked Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on 
your watch!” 

“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. 
Figg to Harry and back again. “Blimey, I ...” 

“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you 
not to go? Didn’t i?” 

“I — well, I — ” Mundungus looked deeply 
uncomfortable. “It ... it was a very good business 
opportunity, see ...” 

Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag 
dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face 
and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it 
made it was full of cat food. 

“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! 

Someone’s gotta tell Dumbledore!” 

“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging 
the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she 
could reach. “And — it — had — better — be — you — 
and — you — can — tell — him — why — you — 
weren’t — there — to — help!” 

“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms 
over his head, cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!” 

And with another loud crack, he vanished. 

“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg 
furiously. “Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting 
for?” 

Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on 
pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley’s 

Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and 
staggered onward. 

“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they 
turned into Privet Drive. “Just in case there are more 
of them around... Oh my word, what a catastrophe ... 
and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and 
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing 
magic at all costs... Well, it’s no good crying over 
spilled potion, I suppose ... but the cat’s among the 
pixies now ...” 

“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore ’s ... been having ... 
me followed?” 

“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did 
you expect him to let you wander around on your own 
after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they 
told me you were intelligent... Right ... get inside and 
stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I 
expect someone will be in touch with you soon 
enough.” 

“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly. 

“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring 
around the dark street and shuddering. “I’ll need to 
wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. 
Good night.” 

“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know — ” 

But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet 
slippers flopping, string bag clanking. 

“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million 
questions to ask anyone who was in contact with 
Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was 
swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry 

Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his 
slow, painful way up number four’s garden path. 

The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back 
inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and 
watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and 
larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the 
front door. 

“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — 
Diddy, what’s the matter?” 

Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out 
from under his arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a 
moment on the spot, his face pale green, then he 
opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the 
doormat. 

“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? 
VERNON!” 

Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living 
room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as 
it always did when he was agitated. He hurried 
forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed 
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in 
the pool of sick. 

“He’s ill, Vernon!” 

“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss 
give you something foreign for tea?” 

“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you 
been lying on the ground?” 

“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, 
son?” 



Page | 32 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia screamed. 



“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, 
darling, speak to Mummy! What did they do to you?” 

In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed 
Harry, which suited him perfectly. He managed to slip 
inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door 
and while the Dursleys made their noisy progress 
down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved 
carefully and quietly toward the stairs. 

“Who did it, son? Give us names. Well get them, don’t 
worry.” 

“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is 
it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!” 

Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when 
Dudley found his voice. 

“Him” 

Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced 
for the explosion. 

“BOY! COME HERE!” 

With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry 
removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to 
follow the Dursleys. 

The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal 
glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was 
ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green 
and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing in 
front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through 
tiny, narrowed eyes. 



Page | 33 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What have you done to my son?” he said in a 
menacing growl. 



“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that 
Uncle Vernon wouldn’t believe him. 

“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in 
a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of 
Dudley’s leather jacket. “Was it — was it you-know- 
what, darling? Did he use — his thing?” 

Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded. 

“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out 
a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do 
anything to him, it wasn’t me, it was — ” 

But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in 
through the kitchen window. Narrowly missing the 
top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it soared across the 
kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was 
carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned 
gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top 
of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off 
across the garden. 

“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in 
his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen 
window shut. “OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY 
MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!” 

But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and 
pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding 
somewhere in the region of his Adam’s apple. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We have received intelligence that you performed the 
Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this 

Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the 
presence of a Muggle. 

The severity of this breach of the Decree for the 
Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has 
resulted in your expulsion from Hog warts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will 
be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy 
your wand. 

As you have already received an official warning for a 
previous offense under section 13 of the International 
Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret 
to inform you that your presence is required at a 
disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a. m. 
on August 12th. 

Hoping you are well, 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk 

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 
Ministry of Magic 

Harry read the letter through twice. He was only 
vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia 
talking in the vicinity. Inside his head, all was icy and 
numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness 
like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from 
Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back. 

He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was 
purple-faced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt 
Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was 
retching again. 



Page | 35 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to 
reawaken. Ministry representatives will be calling at 
your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. 
There was only one thing for it. He would have to run 
— now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, 
but he was certain of one thing: At Hogwarts or 
outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost 
dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to 
leave the kitchen. 

“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle 
Vernon. When Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across 
the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. “I 
haven’t finished with you, boy!” 

“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly. 

“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son — ” 

“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” 
said Harry, raising the wand. 

“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle 
Vernon. “I know you’re not allowed to use it outside 
that madhouse you call a school!” 

“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So 
I can do whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. 

One — two — ” 

A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia 
screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for 
the third time that night Harry was staring for the 
source of a disturbance he had not made. He spotted 
it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was 
sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided 
with the closed window. 



Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” 
Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the 
window open again. The owl stuck out its leg, to 
which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its 
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled 
off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the 
second message, which was written very hastily and 
blotchily in black ink. 

Harry — 

Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s 
trying to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT 
AND UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANYMORE 
MAGIC. DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND. 

Arthur Weasley 

Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out... What did 
that mean? How much power did Dumbledore have to 
override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance 
that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A 
small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, 
almost immediately strangled by panic — how was he 
supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without 
doing magic? He’d have to duel with the Ministry 
representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to 
escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion. 

His mind was racing. . . He could run for it and risk 
being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait 
for them to find him here. He was much more 
tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mr. 
Weasley had his best interests at heart ... and, after 
all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this 
before... 

“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m 
staying.” 

Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced 
Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared 
taken aback at his abrupt change of mind. Aunt 
Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The 
vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing 
worse than ever. 

“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled. 

“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, 
expelling me,” said Harry calmly; he was straining his 
ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry 
representatives were approaching, and it was easier 
and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than 
to have him start raging and bellowing. “The second 
one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he works at the 
Ministry.” 

“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People 
like you in government? Oh this explains everything, 
everything, no wonder the country’s going to the 
dogs...” 

When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at 
him, then spat, “And why have you been expelled?” 

“Because I did magic.” 

“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down 
on the top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of 
Dudley’s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the 
floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to Dudley?” 

“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That 
wasn’t me — ” 

“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle 
Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping 



Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




gestures at Harry to quiet him while they both bent 
low over Dudley. 

“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” 

“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia. 

“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled. 

“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use — ” Harry began angrily, 
but ... 

“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in 
unison. “Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, 
mustache blowing about furiously. 

“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. 
“Everything dark. And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside 
m-my head ...” 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of 
utter horror. If their least favorite thing in the world 
was magic, closely followed by neighbors who cheated 
more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who 
heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They 
obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind. 

“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed 
Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her 
eyes. 

But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He 
shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and 
despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on 
Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a 
certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive 
the worst moments of their life... What would spoiled, 
pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear? 



Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in 
an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would 
adopt at the bedside of a very ill person. 

“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then — ” 

He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: 
Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled 
the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of 
you. 

“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.” 

“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, 
while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s 
forehead to feel his temperature. “What happened 
then, Dudders?” 

“Felt ... felt ... felt ... as if... as if ...” 

“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied 
tonelessly. 

“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling. 

“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and 
considerable volume as he straightened up. “So you 
put some crackpot spell on my son so he’d hear 
voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery, 
or something, did you?” 

“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, 
temper and voice rising together. “It wasn’t me\ It was 
a couple of dementors!” 

“A couple of — what’s this codswallop?” 

“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. 
“Two of them.” 

Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?” 



“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and 
then Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth 
as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. 
Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s brain 
reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia? 

“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished. 

Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She 
glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then 
lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth. 

“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — 
years ago,” she said jerkily. 

“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use 
their names?” said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia 
ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered. 

Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years 
ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had 
screamed that Harry’s mother had been a freak, he 
had never heard her mention her sister. He was 
astounded that she had remembered this scrap of 
information about the magical world for so long, when 
she usually put all her energies into pretending it 
didn’t exist. 

Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, 
opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently 
struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a 
third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er — they 
— er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy- 
whatsits?” 

Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia nodded. 



Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to 
Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout 
“April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth 
yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more 
words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, 
which zoomed through the still-open window like a 
feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the 
kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to 
jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking 
envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as 
the owl swooped back out into the night. 

“Enough — effing — owls ...” muttered Uncle Vernon 
distractedly, stomping over to the window and 
slamming it shut again. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two 
minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its 
decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may 
retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on 
12th August, at which time an official decision will be 
taken. 

Following discussions with the Headmaster of 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the 
Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion 
will also be decided at that time. You should therefore 
consider yourself suspended from school pending 
further inquiries. 

With best wishes, 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 



Ministry of Magic 

Harry read this letter through three times in quick 
succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened 
slightly at the thought that he was not definitely 
expelled, though his fears were by no means 
banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing 
on the twelfth of August. 

“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his 
surroundings. “What now? Have they sentenced you 
to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?” he 
added as a hopeful afterthought. 

“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry. 

“And they’ll sentence you there?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon 
nastily. 

“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He 
was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a 
letter to Ron, Hermione, or Sirius. 

“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle 
Vernon. “SIT BACK DOWN!” 

“What now?” said Harry impatiently. 

“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know 
exactly what happened to my son!” 

“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold 
sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched 

Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking 
terrified. 

“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia 
Crescent and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking 
fast, fighting to control his temper. “Dudley thought 
he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but 
didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up — ” 

“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon 
furiously. “What do they DO?” 

“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” 
said Harry, “and if they get the chance, they kiss you 



“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping 
slightly. “Kiss you?” 

“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of 
your mouth.” 

Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream. 

“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his — ” 

She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, 
as though testing to see whether she could hear his 
soul rattling around inside him. 

“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they 
had,” said Harry, exasperated. 

“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon 
loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to 
bring the conversation back onto a plane he 
understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?” 



Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said 
Harry through clenched teeth. 

“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. 
“Why isn’t he all empty, then?” 

“Because I used the Patronus — ” 

WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and 
a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of 
the kitchen fireplace. 

“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling 
great clumps of hair out of his mustache, something 
he hadn’t been driven to in a long time. “I WILL NOT 
HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I 
TELL YOU!” 

But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment 
from the owl’s leg. He was so convinced that this 
letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining 
everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the 
Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to 
sort everything out — that for the first time in his life 
he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting. 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls and 
narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as 
the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, 
Harry read Sirius’s message. 

Arthur’s just told us what’s happened. 

Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do. 

Harry found this such an inadequate response to 
everything that had happened tonight that he turned 
the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the 
letter, but there was nothing there. 



Page | 45 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t 
anybody going to say “well done” for fighting off two 
dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. Weasley and 
Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and 
they were saving their tellings-off until they could 
ascertain how much damage had been done. 

“ — a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out 
of my house and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t — ” 

“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, 
crushing Sirius’s letter in his fist. 

“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” 
barked Uncle Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt 
Dudley, how come you’ve been expelled? You did you- 
know-what, you’ve admitted it!” 

Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was 
beginning to ache again. He wanted more than 
anything to get out of the kitchen, away from the 
Dursleys. 

“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the 
dementors,” he said, forcing himself to remain calm. 
“It’s the only thing that works against them.” 

“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” 
said Uncle Vernon in tones of outrage. 

“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.” 

His head was pounding in the glare of the strip 
lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt 
drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at 
him. 

“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got 
something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else 

Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




would they turn up here? Why else would they be 
down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the 
only — ” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the 
word “wizard.” “The only you-know-what for miles.” 

“I don’t know why they were here...” 

But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s 
exhausted brain ground back into action. Why had 
the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it 
be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway 
where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the 
Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had 
they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as 
Dumbledore had predicted they would? 

“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said 
Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train 
of thought. 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could 
just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom 
and think... 

“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle 
Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an 
unassailable conclusion. “That’s it, isn’t it, boy? 

You’re on the run from the law!” 

“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as 
though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now. 

“Then why — ?” 

“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to 
himself than to Uncle Vernon. 



Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“What’s that? Who must have sent them?” 

“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry. 

He registered dimly how strange it was that the 
Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they 
heard words like “wizard,” “magic,” or “wand,” could 
hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time 
without the slightest tremor. 

“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face 
screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension in his 
piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name ... that was the one 
who ...” 

“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said. 

“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, 
without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry’s 
parents might be a painful topic to anybody. “That 
giant bloke said so. He’s gone.” 

“He’s back,” said Harry heavily. 

It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt 
Petunia’s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of- 
the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and 
talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. 

The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging 
seemed to have caused a breach in the great, invisible 
wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of 
Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two lives 
had somehow become fused and everything had been 
turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for 
details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew 
Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around 
Little Whinging and he might never go back to 
Hogwarts. Harry’s head throbbed more painfully. 



Page | 48 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia. 

She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at 
him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time 
in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia 
was his mother’s sister. He could not have said why 
this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he 
knew was that he was not the only person in the 
room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort 
being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in 
her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale 
eyes (so unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in 
dislike or anger: They were wide and fearful. The 
furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained 
all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no 
world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle 
Vernon — seemed to have fallen away. 

“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia 
now. “He came back a month ago. I saw him.” 

Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad 
shoulders and clutched them. 

“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife 
to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and 
confused by the unprecedented understanding that 
seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on. 
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.” 

“Yes.” 

“The one who murdered your parents.” 

“Yes.” 

“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?” 

“Looks like it,” said Harry. 

Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white- 
faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He 
seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching 
before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,” he said, his 
shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can 
get out of this house, boy\” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and 
even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I 
should’ve done it years ago! Owls treating the place 
like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge 
destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on 
the ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! 
You’ve had it! You’re history! You’re not staying here if 
some loony’s after you, you’re not endangering my 
wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down on us, 
if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, 
I’ve had it! OUT!” 

Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the 
Ministry, Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his 
left hand. Don’t leave the house again, whatever you 
do. DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE’S 
HOUSE. 

“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward 
now, so that his massive purple face came closer to 
Harry’s, so that Harry actually felt flecks of spit hit 
his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave half an 
hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never 
darken our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in 
the first place I don’t know. Marge was right, it should 
have been the orphanage, we were too damn soft for 
our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, 
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been 
rotten from the beginning, and I’ve had enough — 
OWLS!” 

Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it 
actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again 
with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize 
the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it 
soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt 
Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms 
over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on 
her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney 
again. 

Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt 
Petunia beat him to it. 

“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear 
what it says anyway. That’s a Howler.” 

“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t 
touch it, it could be dangerous!” 

“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking 
voice. “It’s addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. 

Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet 
Drive — ” 

She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope 
had begun to smoke. 

“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll 
happen anyway — ” 

“No — ” 



Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly 
around the kitchen as though looking for an escape 
route, but too late — the envelope burst into flames. 
Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it. 



Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the 
confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the 
table. 



“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.” 

Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She 
sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her 
hands. The remains of the envelope smoldered into 
ash in the silence. 

“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — 

I don’t — Petunia?” 

Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring 
stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open. The 
silence spiraled horribly. Harry was watching his 
aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to 
burst. 

“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P- 
Petunia?” 

She raised her head. She was still trembling. She 
swallowed. 

“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she 
said weakly. 

“W-what?” 

“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. 

She got to her feet again. 

“He ... but Petunia ...” 

“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she 
said. She was regaining her usual brisk, snappish 
manner rapidly, though she was still very pale. 

Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know 
where he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.” 

Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire. 

“But Petunia, dear — ” 

Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry. 

“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to 
leave the house. Now get to bed.” 

Harry didn’t move. 

“Who was that Howler from?” 

“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped. 

“Are you in touch with wizards?” 

“I told you to get to bed!” 

“What did it mean? Remember the last what?” 

“Go to bed!” 

“How come — ?” 

“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!” 



Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






THE ADVANCED GUARD 

“Fve just been attacked by dementors and I might be 
expelled from Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going 
on and when I’m going to get out of here. ” 

Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces 
of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his 
dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the 
second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl, 
Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the 
desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to 
come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for 
sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with 
tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley 
home, and the two lumps on his head where the 
window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing 
painfully. 

Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and 
frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, 
casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky 
every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to 
get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing 
Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a 
hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one 
was telling him what was going on. 

And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose 
voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through 
the kitchen? 

Why was he still trapped here without information? 
Why was everyone treating him like some naughty 
kid? Don’t do any more magic, stay in the house... 

He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far 
from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had 
a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the 
pain in the rest of his body. 

Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared 
through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small 
ghost. 

“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on 
top of her cage. “You can put that down, IVe got work 
for you!” 

Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully 
at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak. 

“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small 
rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the 
scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take these straight to Sirius, 
Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here without 
good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve 
written decent-length answers if you’ve got to. 
Understand?” 

Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of 
frog. 



Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Get going, then,” said Harry. 

She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, 
Harry threw himself down onto his bed without 
undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition 
to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty 
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only 
friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he’d 
make it up to her when she came back with Sirius’s, 
Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers. 

They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t 
possibly ignore a dementor attack. He’d probably 
wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy 
and plans for his immediate removal to the Burrow. 
And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, 
stifling all further thought. 

•k Jc k 



But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent 
the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the 
bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved 
food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon 
had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry 
heard her approaching he tried to question her about 
the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated 
the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise 
the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry 
couldn’t see the point of forcing his company on 
them; another row would achieve nothing except 
perhaps making him so angry he’d perform more 
illegal magic. 

So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled 
alternately with restless energy that made him unable 
to settle to anything, during which he paced his 
bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for 



Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy 
so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour 
at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with 
dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing. 

What if they ruled against him? What if he was 
expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What 
would he do, where would he go? He could not return 
to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he 
knew the other world, the one to which he really 
belonged... Was it possible that he might be able to 
move into Sirius’s house, as Sirius had suggested a 
year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the 
Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there 
alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the 
matter of where he went next be decided for him; had 
his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy 
been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? 
Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid 
off his bed and began pacing again. 

On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry 
was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at 
the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his 
uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly 
around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best 
suit and an expression of enormous smugness. 

“We’re going out,” he said. 

“Sorry?” 

“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are 
going out.” 

“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling. 

“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are 
away.” 

Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Okay.” 



“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any 
of our possessions.” 

“Right.” 

“You are not to steal food from the fridge.” 

“Okay.” 

“I am going to lock your door.” 

“You do that.” 

Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of 
this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room 
and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key 
turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s footsteps walking 
heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard 
the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, 
and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out 
of the drive. 

Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys 
leaving. It made no difference to him whether they 
were in the house or not. He could not even summon 
the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. 
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay 
listening to the night sounds through the window he 
kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed 
moment when Hedwig returned. 

The empty house creaked around him. The pipes 
gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking 
of nothing, suspended in misery. 

And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the 
kitchen below. 

Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys 
couldn’t be back, it was much too soon, and in any 
case he hadn’t heard their car. 

There was silence for a few seconds, and then he 
heard voices. 

Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet 
— but a split second later it occurred to him that 
burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever 
was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not 
troubling to do so. 

He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and 
stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his 
might. Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a 
loud click and his door swung open. 

Harry stood motionless, staring through the open 
door at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears 
for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a 
moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of 
his room to the head of the stairs. 

His heart shot upward into his throat. There were 
people standing in the shadowy hall below, 
silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through 
the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he 
could see, looking up at him. 

“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye 
out,” said a low, growling voice. 

Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew 
that voice, but he did not lower his wand. 

“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly. 



Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ ” growled the 
voice, “never got round to much teaching, did I? Get 
down here, we want to see you properly.” 

Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his 
grip on it, nor did he move. He had very good reason 
to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months 
in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody’s 
company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, 
but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had 
tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before 
he could make a decision about what to do next, a 
second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs. 

“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.” 

Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he 
hadn’t heard it for more than a year. 

“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that 
you?” 

“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third 
voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. 
“Lumos.” 

A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical 
light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded 
around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at 
him, some craning their heads for a better look. 

Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite 
young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more 
gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, 
and his robes were more patched and shabbier than 
ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, 
who tried to smile back through his shock.

“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the 
witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked 
the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, 
dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a 
violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!” 

“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald 
black wizard standing farthest back; he had a deep, 
slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear. “He 
looks exactly like James.” 

“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired 
wizard at the back. “Lily’s eyes.” 

Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and 
a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting 
suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. 
One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other 
large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that 
could see through walls, doors, and the back of 
Moody’s own head. 

“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d 
be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater 
impersonating him. We ought to ask him something 
only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone 
brought any Veritaserum?” 

“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said 
Lupin. 

“A stag,” said Harry nervously. 

“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin. 

Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of 
everybody still staring at him, stowing his wand into 
the back pocket of his jeans as he came. 



Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. 
“What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost 
buttocks, you know!” 

“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet- 
haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly. 

“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your 
back pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand 
safety, nobody bothers about it anymore...” He 
stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw that,” he 
added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the 
ceiling. 

Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s. 

“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely. 
“F-fine ...” 

Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks 
with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove 
him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of 
wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as 
though this were a long-standing arrangement. He 
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were 
still gazing avidly at him. He felt very conscious of the 
fact that he had not combed his hair for four days. 

“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out ...” he 
mumbled. 

“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me 
that lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by 
Muggle post telling them they’d been short-listed for 
the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn 
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving 
right now... Or they think they are.” 



Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face 
when he realized there was no All-England Best-Kept 
Suburban Lawn Competition. 

“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?” 

“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for 
the all-clear.” 

“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked 
hopefully. 

“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry 
toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, 
all still eyeing Harry curiously. “Too risky. We’ve set 
up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It’s taken 
a while...” 

Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table 
swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in 
all directions, taking in the Dursleys’ many labor- 
saving appliances. 

“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, 
pointing toward Moody. 

“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd 
to be introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d 
known for a year. 

“And this is Nymphadora — ” 

“ Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young 
witch with a shudder. “It’s Tonks.” 

“ — Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by 
her surname only,” finished Lupin. 



Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you 
‘Nymphadora, ’ ” muttered Tonks. 

“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the 
tall black wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the 
wheezy-voiced wizard nodded — “Dedalus Diggle — ” 

“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, 
dropping his top hat. 

“ — Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an 
emerald-green shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis 
Podmore” — a square-jawed wizard with thick, straw- 
colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A pink- 
cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the 
toaster. 

Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as 
they were introduced. He wished they would look at 
something other than him; it was as though he had 
suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered 
why so many of them were there. 

“A surprising number of people volunteered to come 
and get you,” said Lupin, as though he had read 
Harry’s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched 
slightly. 

“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. 
“We’re your guard, Potter.” 

“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to 
set off,” said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen 
window. “We’ve got about fifteen minutes.” 

“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the 
witch called Tonks, who was looking around the 
kitchen with great interest. “My dad’s Muggle-born 



Page | 64 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like 
with wizards?” 

“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to 
Lupin — “what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything 
from anyone, what’s Vol — ?” 

Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing 
noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and 
Moody growled, “Shut up\” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” 
said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry; his 
magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling. 
“Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to the 
magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum 
wore it — ” 

And with a nasty squelching sound much like a 
plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his 
eye. 

“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” 
said Tonks conversationally. 

“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked 
Moody. 

Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean 
glass, and filled it with water at the sink, still watched 
eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless 
staring was starting to annoy him. 

“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the 
glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water 
and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, 



Page | 65 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




staring at them all in turn. “I want three-hundred- 
and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” 

“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry 
asked. 

“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to 
Apparate, they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and 
it’s more than our life’s worth to set up an 
unauthorized Portkey.” 

“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley 
Shacklebolt in his deep voice. 

“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his 
watch. “Anyway, you’d better go and get packed, 
Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal 
comes.” 

“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly. 

She followed Harry back into the hall and up the 
stairs, looking around with much curiosity and 
interest. 

“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you 
know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” 
she added, as they entered Harry’s bedroom and he 
turned on the light. 

His room was certainly much messier than the rest of 
the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad 
mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after 
himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over 
the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each 
in turn and thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed 
cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk 
lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle 



Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the 
floor around it. 

Harry started picking up books and throwing them 
hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open 
wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the 
mirror on the inside of the door. 

“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she 
said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you 
think it makes me look a bit peaky?” 

“Er — ” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of 
Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland. 

“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up 
her eyes in a strained expression as though she were 
struggling to remember something. A second later, 
her hair had turned bubble-gum pink. 

“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as 
she opened her eyes again. 

“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at 
her reflection and turning her head so that she could 
see her hair from all directions. “It means I can 
change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting 
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. 

“I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and 
Disguise during Auror training without any study at 
all, it was great.” 

“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a 
Dark wizard catcher was the only career he’d ever 
considered after Hogwarts. 

“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as 
well; he’s a bit higher up than I am, though. I only 
qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and 

Page | 67 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break 
that plate when we arrived downstairs?” 



“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry 
asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting 
about packing. 

Tonks chuckled. 

“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, 
eh?” 

Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s 
forehead. 

“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. 
He did not like people staring at his scar. 

“Well, you 11 have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” 
said Tonks. “Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re 
born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or 
potions to change their appearance... But we’ve got to 
get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she 
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the 
floor. 

“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more 
books. 

“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack).” 
cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping 
movement over the floor. 

Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into 
the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk. 

“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the 
trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. “My 
mum’s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in 

Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




neatly — she even gets the socks to fold themselves — 
but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind 
of flick — ” 

She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks 
gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of 
the mess within. 

“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, 
“at least it’s all in. That could do with a bit of 
cleaning, too — Scourgify — ” She pointed her wand at 
Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings 
vanished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite 
got the hang of these sort of householdy spells. Right 
— got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A 
Firebolt?” 

Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in 
Harry’s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift 
from Sirius, an international standard broomstick. 

“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks 
enviously. “Ah well ... wand still in your jeans? Both 
buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go. Locomotor Trunk.” 

Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding 
her wand like a conductor’s baton, Tonks made it 
hover across the room and out of the door ahead of 
them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed 
her down the stairs carrying his broomstick. 

Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, 
which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made 
Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis 
Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia 
Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come 
across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was 
sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys. 



Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and 
Harry entered. “We’ve got about a minute, I think. We 
should probably get out into the garden so we’re 
ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and 
uncle not to worry — ” 

“They won’t,” said Harry. 

“That you’re safe — ” 

“That’ll just depress them.” 

“ — and you’ll see them next summer.” 

“Do I have to?” 

Lupin smiled but made no answer. 

“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning 
Harry toward him with his wand. “I need to 
Disillusion you.” 

“You need to what?” said Harry nervously. 

“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his 
wand. “Lupin says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, 
but it won’t stay on while we’re flying; this’ll disguise 
you better. Here you go — ” 

He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and 
Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had 
just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be 
running down his body from the point the wand had 
struck. 

“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, 
staring at Harry’s midriff. 



Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had 
been his body, for it didn’t look anything like his 
anymore. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on 
the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind 
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon. 

“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with 
his wand. 

They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s 
beautifully kept lawn. 

“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye 
scanning the heavens. “Could’ve done with a bit more 
cloud cover. Right, you,” he barked at Harry, “we’re 
going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll be right 
in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be 
covering you from below. I’m going to be behind you. 
The rest’ll be circling us. We don’t break ranks for 
anything, got me? If one of us is killed — ” 

“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but 
Moody ignored him. 

“ — the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break 
ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, 

Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; 
keep flying east and they’ll join you.” 

“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not 
taking this seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped 
Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage into a harness 
hanging from her broom. 

“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. 
“Our job’s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if 
we die in the attempt — ” 



Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in 
his deep, calming voice. 

“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said 
Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky. 

Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks 
had flared among the stars. Harry recognized them at 
once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his 
Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it 
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he 
was to be up in the air once more. 

“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more 
sparks, green this time, exploded high above them. 

Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night 
air rushed through his hair as the neat square 
gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly 
into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and 
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from 
his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of 
his head. He felt as though his heart was going to 
explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying 
away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about 
all summer, he was going home... For a few glorious 
moments, all his problems seemed to recede into 
nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky. 

“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” 
shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and 
Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging 
wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height... 
Give it another quarter of a mile!” 

Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared 
upward; he could see nothing below now but tiny 
pinpricks of light that were car headlights and 
streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to 

Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




Uncle Vernon’s car... The Dursleys would be heading 
back to their empty house right now, full of rage 
about the nonexistent lawn competition . . . and Harry 
laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was 
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the 
creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the 
cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they 
sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a 
month, or this happy... 

“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!” 

They soared right, so that they did not pass directly 
over the glittering spiderweb of lights below. 

“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low 
cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody. 

“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks 
angrily. “We’ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!” 

Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands 
were growing numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He 
wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was 
starting to shiver. 

They altered their course every now and then 
according to Mad-Eye ’s instructions. Harry’s eyes 
were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that 
was starting to make his ears ache. He could 
remember being this cold on a broom only once 
before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff 
in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. 
The guard around him was circling continuously like 
giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He 
wondered how long they had been flying; it felt like an 
hour at least. 



Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid 
the motorway!” 

Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly 
for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars 
streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of 
traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to 
spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in 
the flames... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around 
him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the 
moonlight... Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, 
her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then 
she too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis 
Podmore... 

“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure 
we’re not being followed!” Moody shouted. 

“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from 
the front. “We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep 
going off course we’re not going to get there until next 
week! We’re nearly there now!” 

“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. 
“Follow Tonks, Harry!” 

Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading 
for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a 
huge, sprawling, crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines 
and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. 
Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see 
individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and 
television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very 
much, though he felt sure that someone would have 
to unfreeze him from his broom. 

“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later 
she had landed. 



Page | 74 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry touched down right behind her and 
dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the 
middle of a small square. Tonks was already 
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked 
around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses 
were not welcoming; some of them had broken 
windows, glimmering dully in the light from the 
street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the 
doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets 
of front steps. 

“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, 
“In a minute.” 

Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled 
hands clumsy with cold. 

“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver 
cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it. 

The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He 
clicked the un-lighter again; the next lamp went out. 
He kept clicking until every lamp in the square was 
extinguished and the only light in the square came 
from curtained windows and the sickle moon 
overhead. 

“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, 
pocketing the Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any 
Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come 
on, quick.” 

He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch 
of grass, across the road, and onto the pavement. 
Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry’s trunk 
between them, the rest of the guard, all with their 
wands out, flanking them. 



Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an 
upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell 
of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin- 
bags just inside the broken gate. 

“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of 
parchment toward Harry’s Disillusioned hand and 
holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the 
writing. “Read quickly and memorize.” 

Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow 
handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said: 

The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may he 
found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. 



Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 






NUMBER TWELVE, GRIMMAULD 
PLACE 

“What’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began. 

“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re 
inside!” 

He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand 
and set fire to it with his wand tip. As the message 
curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry 
looked around at the houses again. They were 
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left 
and saw number ten; to the right, however, was 
number thirteen. 

“But where’s — ?” 

“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin 
quietly. 

Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the 
part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a 



Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



battered door emerged out of nowhere between 
numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty 
walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra 
house had inflated, pushing those on either side out 
of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number 
eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside 
hadn’t even felt anything. 

“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in 
the back. 

Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the 
newly materialized door. Its black paint was shabby 
and scratched. The silver door knocker was in the 
form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or 
letterbox. 

Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. 
Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what 
sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked 
open. 

“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go 
far inside and don’t touch anything.” 

Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total 
darkness of the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and 
a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of 
a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and 
saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks 
carrying his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was 
standing on the top step and releasing the balls of 
light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-lamps; 
they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond 
glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody 
limped inside and closed the front door, so that the 
darkness in the hall became complete. 

“Here — ” 

Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; 
Harry felt as though something hot was trickling 
down his back this time and knew that the 
Disillusionment Charm must have lifted. 

“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light 
in here,” Moody whispered. 

The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd 
feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just 
entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft 
hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps 
sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a 
flickering insubstantial light over the peeling 
wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy 
hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered 
overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked 
on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind 
the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the 
candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like 
serpents. 

There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. 
Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the 
hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried 
toward them, though Harry noticed that she was 
rather thinner and paler than she had been last time 
he had seen her. 

“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, 
pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding 
him at arm’s length and examining him critically. 
“You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll 
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid...” 

She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and 
whispered urgently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s 
started...” 



Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest 
and excitement and began filing past Harry toward 
the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come; 
Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held 
him back. 

“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the 
Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait 
with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have 
dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,” she 
added in an urgent whisper. 

“Why?” 

“I don’t want to wake anything up.” 

“What d’you — ?” 

“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be 
at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re 
sleeping.” 

Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes 
past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind 
which Harry supposed there must be another door, 
and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked 
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, 
they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of 
shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A 
closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to 
house-elves. All of them had the same rather 
snoutlike nose. 

Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he 
took. What on earth were they doing in a house that 
looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of 
wizards? 

“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”

“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve 
really got to dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered 
distractedly. “There” — they had reached the second 
landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call you 
when it’s over.” 

And she hurried off downstairs again. 

Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom 
doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent’s head, 
and opened the door. 

He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, 
twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering 
noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his 
vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of 
very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto 
him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while 
Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round 
and round their heads. 

“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear 
you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have 
you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our 
letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell you 
anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, 
oh, we’ve got so much to tell you, and you’ve got to 
tell us — the dementors! When we heard — and that 
Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve looked it 
all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s 
provision in the Decree for the Restriction of 
Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life- 
threatening situations — ” 

“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, 
closing the door behind Harry. He seemed to have 
grown several more inches during their month apart, 
making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, 



Page | 81 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles 
were the same. 

Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before 
she could say another word there was a soft 
whooshing sound and something white soared from 
the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on 
Harry’s shoulder. 

“Hedwig!” 

The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear 
affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers. 

“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us 
half to death when she brought your last letters, look 
at this — ” 

He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, 
which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut. 

“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I 
wanted answers, you know...” 

“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. 
“Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you’d do 
something stupid if you were stuck all on your own 
without news, but Dumbledore made us — ” 

“ — swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, 
Hermione’s already said.” 

The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight 
of his two best friends was extinguished as something 
icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden — 
after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt 
he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone. 



Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked 
Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the 
others. 

“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione 
rather breathlessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.” 

“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too 
bore the marks of Hedwig’s beak and found that he 
was not at all sorry. 

“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles 
— ” Ron began. 

“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either 
of you been attacked by dementors this summer?” 

“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the 
Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — ” 

Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had 
just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had 
known he was being followed except him. 

“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, 
doing his utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look 
after myself after all, didn’t I?” 

“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost 
awestruck voice. “Dumbledore. We saw him. When he 
found out Mundungus had left before his shift had 
ended. He was scary.” 

“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he 
hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore 
would probably have left me at Privet Drive all 
summer.” 



Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Aren’t you ... aren’t you worried about the Ministry of 
Magic hearing?” said Hermione quietly. 

“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, 
looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on 
his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his 
spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of 
canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that 
relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as 
Harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking 
out of sight snigger. 

“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the 
dark?” Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice 
casual. “Did you — er — bother to ask him at all?” 

He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a 
look that told him he was behaving just as they had 
feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper. 

“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was 
going on,” said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really 
busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came 
here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us 
swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, 
he said the owls might be intercepted — ” 

“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” 
Harry said shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t 
know ways to send messages without owls.” 

Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought 
that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything.” 

“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, 
watching their expressions. 

“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly 
disconcerted. 

Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Or that I can’t take care of myself — ” 



“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione 
anxiously. 

“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while 
you two get to join in everything that’s going on 
here?” said Harry, the words tumbling over one 
another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every 
word. “How come you two are allowed to know 
everything that’s going on — ?” 

“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near 
the meetings, she says we’re too young — ” 

But before he knew it, Harry was shouting. 

“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG 
DEAL! YOUVE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN T YOU? 
YOUVE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, IVE BEEN 
STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND IVE 
HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWOVE EVER 
MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO 
SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? WHO GOT RID 
OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM 
THE DEMENTORS?” 

Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had 
in the past month was pouring out of him; his 
frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had 
all been together without him, his fury at being 
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was 
half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. 

Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top 
of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm 
and zoomed even faster around their heads. 

“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES 
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO 

Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE 
FROM HIM? ME!” 



Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, 
clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, 
while Hermione looked on the verge of tears. 

“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? 
WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME 
WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?” 



“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did — ” 
Hermione began. 



“CANTVE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR 
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE 
MADE YOU SWEAR — ” 



“Well, he did — ” 

“FOUR WEEKS IVE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, 
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND 
OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON — ” 



“We wanted to — ” 

“I SUPPOSE YOUVE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, 
HAVENT YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER — ” 

“No, honest — ” 

“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, 
her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely 
right, Harry — I’d be furious if it was me!” 

Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then 
turned away from them again, pacing up and down. 
Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. 



Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful 
creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet. 

“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and 
Hermione. 

“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron 
at once. 

“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order 
of the Phoenix — ?” 

“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. 
“Dumbledore’s in charge, he founded it. It’s the people 
who fought against You-Know-Who last time.” 

“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his 
hands in his pockets. 

“Quite a few people — ” 

“ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but 
we think there are more...” 

Harry glared at them. 

“ Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other. 
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?” 

“Voldemorti” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and 
Hermione winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up 
to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?” 

“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their 
meetings,” said Hermione nervously. “So we don’t 
know the details — but we’ve got a general idea — ” 
she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face. 



Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, 
see,” said Ron. “They’re really useful.” 



“Extendable — ?” 

“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately 
because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and 
George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning 
them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before 
Mum realized what was going on. We know some of 
the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping 
tabs on them, you know — ” 

“ — some of them are working on recruiting more 
people to the Order — ” said Hermione. 

“ — and some of them are standing guard over 
something,” said Ron. “They’re always talking about 
guard duty.” 

“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry 
sarcastically. 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning 
comprehension. 

Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, 
looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. “So what 
have you two been doing, if you’re not allowed in 
meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d been busy.” 

“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been 
decontaminating this house, it’s been empty for ages 
and stuff’s been breeding in here. We’ve managed to 
clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I 
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!” 

With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder 
twin brothers, had materialized out of thin air in the 

Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly 
than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the 
wardrobe. 

“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, 
who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though 
stockier and slightly shorter. 

“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We 
thought we heard your dulcet tones.” 

“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, 
Harry, let it all out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There 
might be a couple of people fifty miles away who 
didn’t hear you.” 

“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked 
Harry grumpily. 

“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what 
looked like a piece of very long, flesh-colored string. 

“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer 
to walk down the stairs,” said Ron. 

“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, 
Harry, you’re interfering with reception. Extendable 
Ears,” he added in response to Harry’s raised 
eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now 
saw was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to 
hear what’s going on downstairs.” 

“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. 
“If Mum sees one of them again ...” 

“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re 
having,” said Fred. 



Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The door opened and a long mane of red hair 
appeared. 

“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, 
brightly. “I thought I heard your voice.” 

Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with 
the Extendable Ears, she’s gone and put an 
Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.” 

“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen. 

“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just 
chuck stuff at the door and if it can’t make contact 
the door’s been Imperturbed. I’ve been flicking 
Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they 
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the 
Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.” 

Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied 
finding out what old Snape’s been up to.” 

“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?” 

“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and 
sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny 
followed. “Giving a report. Top secret.” 

“Git,” said Fred idly. 

“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly. 

Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way 
he looks at us when he sees us...” 

“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though 
that settled the matter. 



Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his 
thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to 
keep shouting. He sank onto the bed opposite the 
others. 

“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in 
Egypt.” 

“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and 
work for the Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the 
tombs, but,” he smirked, “there are compensations...” 

“What d’you mean?” 

“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s 
got a job at Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish — ” 

“ — and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” 
sniggered Fred. 

“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s 
still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign 
wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie’s trying to 
make contacts on his days off.” 

“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he 
had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in 
the Department of International Magical Cooperation 
at the Ministry of Magic. 

At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione 
exchanged darkly significant looks. 

“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of 
Mum and Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice. 

“Why not?” 



Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad 
breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” 
Fred said. 

“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly. 

“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an 
uncharacteristically ugly look on his face. 

“What’s happened?” Harry said. 

“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen 
Dad row with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum 
who shouts...” 

“It was the first week back after term ended,” said 
Ron. “We were about to come and join the Order. 
Percy came home and told us he’d been promoted.” 

“You’re kidding?” said Harry. 

Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly 
ambitious, Harry’s impression was that Percy had not 
made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of 
Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight 
of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled 
by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed 
that — they all thought that Mr. Crouch had gone 
mad). 

“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because 
Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there 
was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought 
to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and 
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left 
him in charge, he wasn’t going to complain...” 

“So how come they promoted him?” 



Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who 
seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going 
now that Harry had stopped yelling. “He came home 
really pleased with himself — even more pleased than 
usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d 
been offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really 
good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts — 
Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to 
be all impressed, I think.” 

“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly. 

“Why not?” said Harry. 

“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the 
Ministry checking that nobody’s having any contact 
with Dumbledore,” said George. 

“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these 
days, see,” said Fred. “They all think he’s just making 
trouble saying You-Know- Who’s back.” 

“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s 
in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” 
said George. 

“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s 
friendly with Dumbledore, and he’s always thought 
Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle 
obsession — ” 

“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, 
confused. 

“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants 
Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy 
on the family — and Dumbledore.” 



Harry let out a low whistle. 

Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Bet Percy loved that.” 

Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. 

“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said 
loads of terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to 
struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he 
joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition 
and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not 
had a lot of money, I mean — ” 

“ What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a 
noise like an angry cat. 

“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. 

He said Dad was an idiot to run around with 
Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big 
trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and 
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it 
was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were 
going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going 
to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong to our 
family anymore. And he packed his bags the same 
night and left. He’s living here in London now.” 

Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked 
Percy least of Ron’s brothers, but he had never 
imagined he would say such things to Mr. Weasley. 

“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — 
crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and 
talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I 
dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — 
ignores him, I s’pose.” 

“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry 
slowly. “He’s not stupid, he must know your mum 
and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ” 



Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said 
Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the 
only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... he 
didn’t think it was good enough.” 

“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said 
Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded. 

“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking 
around at them all. They were all regarding him 
warily. 

“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily 
Prophet?” Hermione asked nervously. 

“Yeah, I have!” said Harry. 

“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” 
Hermione asked still more anxiously. 

“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they 
were going to report anything about Voldemort it 
would be headline news, wouldn’t it!” 

The others flinched at the sound of the name. 
Hermione hurried on, “Well, you’d need to read it 
cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they 
mention you a couple of times a week.” 

“But I’d have seen — ” 

“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you 
wouldn’t,” said Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not 
talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like 
you’re a standing joke.” 

“What d’you — ?” 



Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of 
forced calm. “They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.” 

“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?” 

“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got 
any choice,” Hermione added with satisfaction. “But 
she laid the foundation for what they’re trying to do 
now.” 

“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently. 

“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing 
all over the place and saying your scar was hurting 
and all that?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita 
Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry. 

“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this 
deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a 
great tragic hero or something,” said Hermione, very 
fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry 
to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in 
snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story 
appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of 
Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny accident or 
anything it’s let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his 
forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next — ’ ” 

“I don’t want anyone to worship — ” Harry began 
hotly. 

“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking 
frightened. “I know, Harry. But you see what they’re 
doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody 
will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They 
want wizards on the street to think you’re just some 
stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous 
Page | 96 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




tall stories because he loves being famous and wants 
to keep it going.” 

“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my 
parentsV’ Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he 
murdered my family but couldn’t kill me! Who wants 
to be famous for that? Don’t they think I’d rather it’d 
never — ” 

“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly. 

“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the 
dementors attacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s 
told them to keep that quiet. That should’ve been a 
really big story, out-of-control dementors. They 
haven’t even reported that you broke the International 
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would 
tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid 
show-off — we think they’re biding their time until 
you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go to town 
— I mean, if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on 
hastily, “you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by 
their own laws, there’s no case against you.” 

They were back on the hearing and Harry did not 
want to think about it. He cast around for another 
change of subject, but was saved the necessity of 
finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the 
stairs. 

“Uh-oh.” 

Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was 
another loud crack and he and George vanished. 
Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom 
doorway. 

“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have 
dinner now, everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And 

Page | 97 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen 
door?” 



“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves 
playing with them.” 

“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have 
been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. 
Now don’t forget to keep your voices down in the hall. 
Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been 
doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please...” 

Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother 
out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and 
Hermione again. Both of them were watching him 
apprehensively, as though they feared that he would 
start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. 
The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel 
slightly ashamed. 

“Look ...” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and 
Hermione said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, 
Harry, we really don’t blame you, but you’ve got to 
understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore — ” 

“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly. 

He cast around for a topic to change the subject from 
Dumbledore — the very thought of him made Harry’s 
insides burn with anger again. 

“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked. 

“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. 
Never met one like him.” 

Hermione frowned at Ron. 

“He’s not a nutter, Ron — ” 

Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and 
stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,” said Ron 
irritably. “Is that normal, Hermione?” 

“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault — ” 

Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. 

“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew — ” 

“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the 
Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s 
not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to 
Kreacher too — ” 

“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.” 

He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, 
but before they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” 
Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and 
Hermione walking any farther. “They’re still in the 
hall, we might be able to hear something — ” 

The three of them looked cautiously over the 
banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with 
witches and wizards, including all of Harry’s guard. 
They were whispering excitedly together. In the very 
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired 
head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher 
at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leaned farther 
over the banisters. He was very interested in what 
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . 

A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front 
of Harry’s eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George 
on the landing above, cautiously lowering the 
Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below. 
A moment later, however, they began to move toward 
the front door and out of sight. 

Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted 
the Extendable Ear back up again. 

They heard the front door open and then close. 

“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. 
“Thank God. C’mon.” 

“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, 
Harry,” Hermione whispered. 

As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall 
they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front 
door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts 
behind those who had just left. 

“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley 
whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. 
“Harry, dear, if youll just tiptoe across the hall, it’s 
through this door here — ” 

CRASH. 

“Tonksl” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to 
look behind her. 

“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the 
floor. “It’s that stupid umbrella stand, that’s the 
second time I’ve tripped over — ” 

But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, 
earsplitting, bloodcurdling screech. 

The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed 
earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind 
them. For a split second, Harry thought he was 
looking through a window, a window behind which an 
old woman in a black cap was screaming and 
screaming as though she was being tortured — then 
Page | lOOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the 
most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever 
seen in his life. 

The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, 
the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she 
screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the 
other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that 
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and 
clapped his hands over his ears. 

Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to 
tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they 
would not close and she screeched louder than ever, 
brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at 
their faces. 

“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half- 
breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How 
dare you befoul the house of my fathers — ” 

Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same 
time dragging the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the 
floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close 
the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, 
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then 
a man with long black hair came charging out of a 
door facing Harry. 

“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, 
seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. 

The old woman’s face blanched. 

“Yooooul” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of 
the man. “Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my 
fleshl” 



Page | lOlHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a 
stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the 
curtains closed again. 

The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing 
silence fell. 

Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out 
of his eyes, Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face 
him. 

“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my 
mother.”

THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX 

“Your — ?” 

“My dear old mum, yeah,” said Sirius. “We’ve been 
trying to get her down for a month but we think she 
put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the 
canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all 
wake up again.” 

“But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” 
Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the 
door from the hall and led the way down a flight of 
narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. 

“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ 
house,” said Sirius. “But I’m the last Black left, so it’s 
mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters 
— about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.” 

Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how 
hard and bitter Sirius’s voice sounded. He followed 
his godfather to the bottom of the stairs and through 
a door leading into the basement kitchen. 

Page | 103Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a 
cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the 
light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the 
room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle 
fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of 
heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark 
ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room 
for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the 
middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, 
goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what 
appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, 
Bill, were talking quietly with their heads together at 
the end of the table. 

Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, 
balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed 
glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet. 

“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet 
him and shaking his hand vigorously. “Good to see 
you!” 

Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his 
long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths 
of parchment left on the table. 

“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill called, trying to gather 
up twelve scrolls at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you 
come via Greenland, then?” 

“He tried,” said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and 
immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last 
piece of parchment. “Oh no — sorry — ” 

“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding 
exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a 
wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. 
Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what 
looked like the plan of a building. 

Page | 104Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the 
plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily 
laden arms. 

“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly 
at the end of meetings,” she snapped before sweeping 
off toward an ancient dresser from which she started 
unloading dinner plates. 

Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanescol” and the 
scrolls vanished. 

“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. “You’ve met 
Mundungus, haven’t you?” 

The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a 
prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. 

“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled 
sleepily. “I ’gree with Sirius...” 

He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though 
voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny 
giggled. 

“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat 
down around him at the table. “Harry’s arrived.” 

“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry 
through his matted ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. 

Yeah ... you all right, ’arry?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still 
staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. 

He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his 
wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing 
clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds. 
Page | 105Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle 
of the smelly cloud. 

“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, 
“will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, 
especially not when we’re about to eat!” 

“Ah,” said Mundungus. “Right. Sorry, Molly.” 

The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed 
his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of 
burning socks lingered. 

“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a 
hand,” Mrs. Weasley said to the room at large. “No, 
you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you’ve had a 
long journey — ” 

“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonks enthusiastically, 
bounding forward. 

Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. 

“Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, 
you’ve done enough today — ” 

“No, no, I want to help!” said Tonks brightly, knocking 
over a chair as she hurried toward the dresser from 
which Ginny was collecting cutlery. 

Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat 
and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. 
Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron 
dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, 
more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was 
left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was 
still blinking mournfully at him. 

“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked. 

Page | 106Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.” 



“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning 
forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a 
business opportunity — ” 

Harry felt something brush against his knees and 
started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione’s 
bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once 
around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto 
Sirius’s lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him 
absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still 
grim-faced, to Harry. 

“Had a good summer so far?” 

“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry. 

For the first time, something like a grin flitted across 
Sirius’s face. 

“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.” 

“ What?” said Harry incredulously. 

“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A 
deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the 
monotony nicely. You think you’ve had it bad, at least 
you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your 
legs, get into a few fights... I’ve been stuck inside for a 
month.” 

“How come?” asked Harry, frowning. 

“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and 
Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus 
by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big 
disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for the 
Order of the Phoenix ... or so Dumbledore feels.” 

Page | 107Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




There was something about the slightly flattened tone 
of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name 
that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with 
the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of 
affection for his godfather. 

“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said 
bracingly. 

“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to 
Snape’s reports, having to take all his snide hints that 
he’s out there risking his life while I’m sat on my 
backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . 
asking me how the cleaning’s going — ” 

“What cleaning?” asked Harry. 

“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” 
said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal 
kitchen. “No one’s lived here for ten years, not since 
my dear mother died, unless you count her old 
house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t 
cleaned anything in ages — ” 

“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to 
have paid any attention to this conversation, but had 
been minutely examining an empty goblet. “This solid 
silver, mate?” 

“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest 
fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed 
with the Black family crest.” 

“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, 
polishing it with his cuff. 

“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. 
Weasley shrieked. 



Page | 108Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a 
split second later, dived away from the table. Fred 
and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, 
an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden 
breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through 
the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of 
the table and came to a halt just before the end, 
leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the 
flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its 
contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off 
the board and landed, point down and quivering 
ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right hand had 
been seconds before. 

“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. 
“THERE WAS NO NEED — IVE HAD ENOUGH OF 
THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE 
MAGIC NOW YOU DONT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR 
WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!” 

“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, 
hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out 
of the table. “Sorry Sirius, mate — didn’t mean to — ” 

Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, 
who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing 
as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry 
hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his 
large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. 

“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into 
the middle of the table, “your mother’s right, you’re 
supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you’ve 
come of age — ” 

“ — none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” 
Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh 
flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost 
as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need to Apparate 

Page | 109Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he 
met! Percy — ” 

She stopped dead, catching her breath with a 
frightened look at her husband, whose expression 
was suddenly wooden. 

“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly. 

“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew 
onto a plate for her and handing it across the table. 

For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink 
of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as 
everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs. 

Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been meaning 
to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing 
desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and 
shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I 
thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it 
before we let it out.” 

“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently. 

“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. 
Weasley went on. “I thought we might try and tackle 
them tomorrow.” 

“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the 
sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone 
else did. 

Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione 
and Ginny by transforming her nose between 
mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the 
same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s 
bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance 
like Snape’s, shrank to something resembling a 
button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of 
Page | llOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular 
mealtime entertainment, because after a while 
Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite 
noses. 

“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ...” 

Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting 
impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him 
from across the table. 

Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense 
discussion about goblins. 

“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I 
still can’t work out whether they believe he’s back or 
not. ’Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. 
Keep out of it.” 

“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” 
said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered 
losses too. Remember that goblin family he murdered 
last time, somewhere near Nottingham?” 

“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. 
“And I’m not talking about gold; if they’re offered 
freedoms we’ve been denying them for centuries 
they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had 
any luck with Ragnok, Bill?” 

“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said 
Bill. “He hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman 
business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, 
those goblins never got their gold from him, you know 



A gale of laughter from the middle of the table 
drowned the rest of Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, 
and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats. 

Page | lllHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




"... and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running 
down his face, “and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to 
me, ’e says, ‘’ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads 
from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and nicked 
all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, 
what next? So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ 
And if you’ll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle 
buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what ’e 
paid in the first place — ■” 

“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your 
business dealings, thank you very much, 
Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron 
slumped forward onto the table, howling with 
laughter. 

“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping 
his eyes and winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will 
nicked ’em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I 
wasn’t really doing nothing wrong — ” 

“I don’t know where you learned about right and 
wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a 
few crucial lessons,” said Mrs. Weasley coldly. 

Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of 
butterbeer; George was hiccuping. For some reason, 
Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before 
getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb 
crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his 
godfather. 

“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in 
an undertone. 

“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very 
quietly. 



Page | 112Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks 
— well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s 
also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of 
a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung 
around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks 
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She 
hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was 
supposed to be tailing you.” 

Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later 
and the waistband on Harry’s jeans was feeling 
uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as 
the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down his 
spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. 
Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete 
and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now 
back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured 
Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting 
cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for 
him to chase. 

“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a 
yawn. 

“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his 
empty plate and turning to look at Harry. “You know, 
I’m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you’d do 
when you got here would be to start asking questions 
about Voldemort.” 

The atmosphere in the room changed with the 
rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of 
dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily 
relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had 
gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s 
name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of 
wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary. 



Page | 113Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and 
Hermione but they said we’re not allowed in the 
Order, so — ” 

“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re 
too young.” 

She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists 
clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness 
gone. 

“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of 
the Phoenix to ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s 
been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He’s 
got the right to know what’s been happen — ” 

“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly. 

“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said 
Fred angrily. 

“ We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month 
and you haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said 
George. 

“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said 
Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily 
like his mother’s. “Harry’s not even of age!” 

“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the 
Order’s doing,” said Sirius calmly. “That’s your 
parents’ decision. Harry, on the other hand — ” 

“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” 
said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face 
looked dangerous. “You haven’t forgotten what 
Dumbledore said, I suppose?” 



Page | 114Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as 
though readying himself for a fight. 

“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs 
to know,” said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy 
emphasis on the last three words. 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from 
Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis 
rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned 
butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her 
mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on 
Sirius. 

“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to 
know, Molly,” said Sirius. “But as he was the one who 
saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a 
collective shudder around the table at the name), “he 
has more right than most to — ” 

“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said 
Mrs. Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and — ” 

“ — and he’s dealt with as much as most in the 
Order,” said Sirius, “and more than some — ” 

“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, 
her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her 
chair. “But he’s still — ” 

“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently. 

“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the 
color rising in her cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!” 

“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said 
Sirius coldly. 



Page | 115Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




‘Tm not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. 

“Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it’s as 
though you think you’ve got your best friend back!” 

“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry. 

“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, 
however much you might look like him!” said Mrs. 
Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. “You are still 
at school and adults responsible for you should not 
forget it!” 

“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded 
Sirius, his voice rising. 

“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, 
which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to 
stay at home and — ” 

“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of 
this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly. 

“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her 
husband. “Arthur, back me up!” 

Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his 
glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not 
looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them 
carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore knows 
the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that 
Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now 
that he is staying at headquarters — ” 

“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and 
inviting him to ask whatever he likes!” 

“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from 
Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, 
hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, “I 

Page | 116Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the 
facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather 
than a garbled version from ... others.” 

His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that 
Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had 
survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge. 

“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and 
looking around the table for support that did not 
come, “well ... I can see I’m going to be overruled. I’ll 
just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons 
for not wanting Harry to know too much, and 
speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best 
interests at heart — ” 

“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly. 

“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who 
else has he got?” 

“He’s got me!” 

“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing 
is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him 
while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” 

Sirius started to rise from his chair. 

“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who 
cares about Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit 
down.” 

Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank 
slowly back into his chair, his face white. 

“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” 

Lupin continued. “He’s old enough to decide for 
himself.” 

Page | 117Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at 
once. 

He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched 
by what she had said about his being as good as a 
son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling. . . 
Sirius was right, he was not a child. 

“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. 
“Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I 
want you out of this kitchen, now.” 

There was instant uproar. 

“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together. 

“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron. 

“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny. 

“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes 
overbright. “I absolutely forbid — ” 

“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. 
Weasley wearily. “They are of age — ” 

“They’re still at school — ” 

“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in 
the same tired voice. 

Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. 

“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but 
Ron — ” 

“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say 
anyway!” said Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he 
added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes. 

Page | 118Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that 
he wouldn’t tell him a single word, that he could try a 
taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked 
it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at 
each other. 

“ ’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione 
beamed. 

“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!” 

Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging 
and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, 
and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black’s 
earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin 
hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only 
after he had returned, closing the kitchen door 
behind him and taking his seat at the table again, 
that Sirius spoke. 

“Okay, Harry ... what do you want to know?” 

Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that 
had been obsessing him for a month. 

“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying 
to watch the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the 
renewed shudders and winces at the name, “and 
there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no 
funny deaths or anything — ” 

“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious 
deaths yet,” said Sirius, “not as far as we know, 
anyway... And we know quite a lot.” 

“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.

“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. 
He knew that Voldemort had murdered more than 
once in the last year alone. 

“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself 
at the moment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous 
for him. His comeback didn’t come off quite the way 
he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.” 

“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with 
a satisfied smile. 

“How?” Harry asked perplexedly. 

“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. 
“Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to 
know he’d come back. But you survived to bear 
witness.” 

“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his 
return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,” 
said Lupin. “And you made sure Dumbledore knew at 
once.” 

“How has that helped?” Harry asked. 

“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. 
“Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was 
ever scared of!” 

“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the 
Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort 
returned,” said Sirius. 

“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking 
around at them all. 

“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort 
can’t carry out his plans,” said Sirius. 

Page | 120Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked 
quickly. 



“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and 
Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be 
accurate.” 

“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?” 

“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” 
said Sirius. “In the old days he had huge numbers at 
his command; witches and wizards he’d bullied or 
bewitched into following him, his faithful Death 
Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard 
him planning to recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just 
one group he’s after. He’s certainly not going to try 
and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen 
Death Eaters.” 

“So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” 
“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin. 

“How?” 

“Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many 
people as possible that You-Know-Who really has 
returned, to put them on their guard,” said Bill. “It’s 
proving tricky, though.” 

“Why?” 

“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You 
saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, 
Harry. Well, he hasn’t shifted his position at all. He’s 
absolutely refusing to believe it’s happened.” 

“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being 
so stupid? If Dumbledore — ” 

Page | 121Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said 
Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. “Dumbledore.” 

“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks 
sadly. 

“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry 
incredulously. 

“Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. 
“You see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to 
overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be 
Minister of Magic.” 

“But Dumbledore doesn’t want — ” 

“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never 
wanted the Minister’s job, even though a lot of people 
wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. 
Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite 
forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore 
had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the 
job.” 

“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much 
cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, 
and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever 
asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. 
“But it seems that he’s become fond of power now, 
and much more confident. He loves being Minister of 
Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that 
he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring 
up trouble for the sake of it.” 

“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How 
can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up — 
that I’d make it all up?” 



Page | 122Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would 
mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope 
with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly. 
“Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much 
more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s 
lying to destabilize him.” 

“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the 
Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from 
Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people he’s back, 
especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the 
first place. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily 
on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they’re 
calling Dumbledore’s rumormongering, so most of the 
Wizarding community are completely unaware 
anything’s happened, and that makes them easy 
targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the 
Imperius Curse.” 

“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, 
looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, 
Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re letting people 
know he’s back?” 

They all smiled humorlessly. 

“Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer 
and the Ministry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price 
on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start 
handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly. 

“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of 
the community,” said Lupin. “It’s an occupational 
hazard of being a werewolf.” 

“Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the 
Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,” 
said Sirius, “and it’s very important for us to have 



Page | 123Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet 
Voldemort will have them.” 

“We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, 
though,” said Mr. Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — 
she’s too young to have been in the Order of the 
Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a 
huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real 
asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s 
been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in 
Tibet.” 

“But if none of you’s putting the news out that 
Voldemort ’s back — ” Harry began. 

“Who said none of us was putting the news out?” said 
Sirius. “Why d’you think Dumbledore’s in such 
trouble?” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry asked. 

“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin. “Didn’t 
you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported 
that he’d been voted out of the Chairmanship of the 
International Confederation of Wizards because he’s 
getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he 
was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a 
speech announcing Voldemort’s return. They’ve 
demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot 
— that’s the Wizard High Court — and they’re talking 
about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, 
too.” 

“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do 
as long as they don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog 
cards,” said Bill, grinning. 

“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. “If 
he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could 

Page | 124Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is 
Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows 
Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, 
he’s going to go cautiously for a while. If 
Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, You-Know-Who 
will have a clear field.” 

“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death 
Eaters, it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t 
it?” asked Harry desperately. 

“Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and 
bang on their front doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “He 
tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He’s well- 
practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, 
gathering followers is only one thing he’s interested 
in, he’s got other plans too, plans he can put into 
operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating 
on them at the moment.” 

“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked 
swiftly. 

He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the 
most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can 
only get by stealth.” 

When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, 
“Like a weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.” 

“When he was powerful before?” 

“Yes.” 

“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something 
worse than the Avada Kedavra — ?” 

“That’s enough.” 



Page | 125Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the 
door. Harry had not noticed her return from taking 
Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she 
looked furious. 

“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, 
looking around at Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione. 

“You can’t boss us — ” Fred began. 

“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling 
slightly as she looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry 
plenty of information. Any more and you might just 
as well induct him into the Order straightaway.” 

“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, 
I want to fight — ” 

“No.” 

It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but 
Lupin. 

“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he 
said. “Wizards who have left school,” he added, as 
Fred and George opened their mouths. “There are 
dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any 
of you ... I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said 
enough.” 

Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley 
beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One 
by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, 
followed suit. 



Page | 126Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 







THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT 
HOUSE OF BLACK 

Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim. 

“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she 
said as they reached the first landing. “We’ve got a 
busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s asleep,” she 
added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.” 

“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after 
Hermione bade them good night and they were 
climbing to the next floor. “If Ginny’s not lying awake 
waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said 
downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm...” 

“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the 
second landing, pointing them into their bedroom. 

“Off to bed with you.” 

“ ’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins. 

“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking. 

Page | 127Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a 
sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even 
danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The 
blank picture on the wall was now breathing very 
slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant 
was asleep. Harry put on his pajamas, took off his 
glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron 
threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around 
and rustling their wings restlessly. 

“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron 
explained as he pulled on his maroon pajamas. 
“Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls swooping 
around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh 
yeah ... I forgot...” 

He crossed to the door and bolted it. 

“What ’re you doing that for?” 

“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First 
night I was here he came wandering in at three in the 
morning. Trust me, you don’t want to wake up and 
find him prowling around your room. Anyway ...” He 
got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then 
turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could 
see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through 
the grimy window. “What d’you reckon?” 

Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant. 

“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have 
guessed, did they?” he said, thinking of all that had 
been said downstairs. “I mean, all they’ve really said 
is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining Vol — ” 

There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron. 



Page | 128Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ — demort” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to 
start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do.” 



Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” 
he said. “We already knew nearly everything they told 
us, from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit 
was — ” 

Crack. 

“OUCH!” 

“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up 
here.” 

“You two just Apparated on my knees!” 

“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark — ” 

Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George 
leaping down from Ron’s bed. There was a groan of 
bedsprings and Harry’s mattress descended a few 
inches as George sat down near his feet. 

“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly. 

“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry. 

“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting 
next to Ron. “We didn’t hear about that on the old 
Extendables, did we?” 

“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry. 

“Could be anything,” said Fred. 

“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada 
Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron. “What’s worse 
than death?” 

Page | 129Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at 
once,” suggested George. 

“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing 
people,” said Ron fearfully. 

“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said 
Harry. “He doesn’t need anything more efficient than 
that.” 

There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, 
like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon 
could perpetrate. 

“So who d’you thinks got it now?” asked George. 

“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly 
nervous. 

“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred. 

“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?” 

“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the 
Sorcerer’s Stone!” 

“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, 
though!” said Ron. 

“Not necessarily,” said Fred. 

“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. 
“Look at Ginny.” 

“What d’you mean?” said Harry. 

“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her 
Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?” 



Page | 130Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!” 



They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs 
again. 

“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there 
was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish 
from the end of his bed. A few seconds later and they 
heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. 
Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they 
were talking or not. 

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The 
floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading 
upstairs to check on Fred and George. 

“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron 
regretfully. 

Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; 
the evening had been so packed with things to think 
about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours 
mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to 
Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back 
downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly 
heard others making their way upstairs... In fact, 
many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and 
down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care 
of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, 
aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be study in’ weapons this 
term...” And Harry saw that the creatures had 
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him... 

He ducked... 

The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball 
under his bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was 
filling the room. 



Page | 131Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen 
and then she needs you in the drawing room, there 
are loads more doxies than she thought and she’s 
found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.” 

Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed 
and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a 
long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive- 
green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet 
exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put 
their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet 
curtains were buzzing as though swarming with 
invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, 
Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all 
looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over 
their noses and mouths. Each of them was also 
holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at 
the end. 

“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley 
said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, 
pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing 
on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve never 
seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s 
been doing for the last ten years — ” 

Hermione ’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but 
Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at 
Mrs. Weasley at these words. 

“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage — 



“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when 
he wants to, Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just 
entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what 
appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feeding 
Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring 



Page | 132Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




look. “I keep him upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. 
Anyway ... this writing desk ...” 

He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then 
bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry 
now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly. 

“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said 
Sirius, peering through the keyhole, “but perhaps we 
ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it 
out — knowing my mother it could be something 
much worse.” 

“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley. 

They were both speaking in carefully light, polite 
voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had 
forgotten their disagreement of the night before. 

A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, 
followed at once by the cacophony of screams and 
wails that had been triggered the previous night by 
Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand. 

“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said 
Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room. 
They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs. 
Black’s screeches echoed up through the house once 
more: “Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood 
traitors, children of filth ...” 

“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. 

Harry took as much time as he dared to close the 
drawing room door; he wanted to listen to what was 
going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to 
shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because 
she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking 
down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the 
Page | 133Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




front door, and then a deep voice he recognized as 
Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved 
me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave 
a report for Dumbledore...” 

Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, 
Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and 
rejoined the doxy party. 

Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on 
doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household 
Pests, which was lying open on the sofa. 

“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies 
bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of 
antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it.” 

She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in 
front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward. 

“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” 
she said. “They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it 
says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. 
When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this 
bucket.” 

She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and 
raised her own spray. “All right — squirti” 

Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a 
fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the 
material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle- 
sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with 
thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with 
fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of 
Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a 
surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below. 
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket. 



Page | 134Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley 
sharply. “Spray that at once and throw it away!” 

Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling 
doxy between his forefinger and thumb. 

“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy 
quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment 
Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he pocketed it with a 
wink. 

“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our 
Skiving Snack-boxes,” George told Harry under his 
breath. 

Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared 
straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George 
and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, “What 
are Skiving Snackboxes?” 

“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, 
keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not 
seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a 
class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been 
developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, 
color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the 
Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been 
rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you 
swallow the purple half — ” 

“ ‘ — which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to 
pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during 
an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to 
unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re putting in 
the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged 
over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now 
sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding 
them to his pocket. “But they still need a bit of work. 
At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble 
Page | 135Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple 
end.” 



“Testers?” 

“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the 
Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed 
Nougat — ” 

“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George. 

“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, 
pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray. 

“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” 
said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. 
Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before 
returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail- 
order service at the moment. We put advertisements 
in the Daily Prophet last week.” 

“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t 
worry ... Mum hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the 
Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about 
you and Dumbledore.” 

Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to 
take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won 
in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize 
their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still 
glad to know that his part in furthering their plans 
was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that 
running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of 
her sons. 

The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the 
morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley 
finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a 
sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of 

Page | 136Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The 
curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and 
damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious 
doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them 
beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which 
Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George 
were shooting covetous looks. 

“I think well tackle those after lunch.” 

Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted 
cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. 
They were crammed with an odd assortment of 
objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled 
snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes 
inscribed with languages Harry could not understand 
and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with 
a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry 
was quite sure was blood. 

The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at 
Mrs. Weasley. 

“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of 
rats as Mrs. Blacks screeches started up again from 
down below. “I’ll bring up some sandwiches.” 

She left the room, closing the door carefully behind 
her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to 
look down onto the doorstep. They could see the top 
of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of 
precariously balanced cauldrons. 

“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all 
those cauldrons for?” 

“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said 
Harry. “Isn’t that what he was doing the night he was 



Page | 137Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy 
cauldrons?” 



“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door 
opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it 
and disappeared from view. “Blimey, Mum won’t like 
that...” 

He and George crossed to the door and stood beside 
it, listening intently. Mrs. Black’s screaming had 
stopped again. 

“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred 
muttered, frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear 
properly ... d’you reckon we can risk the Extendable 
Ears?” 

“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak 
upstairs and get a pair — ” 

But at that precise moment there was an explosion of 
sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable 
Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear 
exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of 
her voice. 

“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN 
GOODS!” 

“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said 
Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened 
the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley ’s voice to 
permeate the room better. “It makes such a nice 
change.” 

COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE 
HAVENT GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT 
WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS 
INTO THE HOUSE — ” 

Page | 138Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said 
George, shaking his head. “You’ve got to head her off 
early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and 
goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go 
at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was 
supposed to be following you, Harry — and there goes 
Sirius’s mum again — ” 

Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and 
screams from the portraits in the hall. George made 
to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he 
could do so, a house-elf edged into the room. 

Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around 
its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. 
Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and 
though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a 
quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike 
ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and 
its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike. 

The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the 
rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it 
shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward 
the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all 
the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, "... 
Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she’s 
no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats 
messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor 
Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let 
in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh 
the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and 
traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he 
do...” 

“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the 
door with a snap. 



Page | 139Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, 
and then gave a very pronounced and very 
unconvincing start of surprise. 

“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning 
around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he 
added, perfectly audibly, “Nasty little brat of a blood 
traitor it is.” 

“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.” 

“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second 
bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, “and 
there’s its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.” 

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf 
straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, 
and apparently convinced that they could not hear 
him as he continued to mutter. 

"... and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as 
brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and 
there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t know his name, 
what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know ...” 

“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. 
“Harry Potter.” 

Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster 
and more furiously than ever. 

“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she 
is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such 
company, oh what would she say — ” 

“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny 
together, very angrily. 



Page | 140Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in 
his right mind, he doesn’t know what he’s — ” 

“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what 
he’s saying,” said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great 
dislike. 

Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry. 

“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the 
scar, it must be true, that’s that boy who stopped the 
Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it — ” 

“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred. 

“What do you want anyway?” George asked. 

Kreacher ’s huge eyes darted onto George. 

“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively. 

“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry. 

Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf 
from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; 
perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved 
their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of 
Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low 
bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. 

“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, 
what are you up to?” 

“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher 
lives to serve the noble house of Black — ” 

“ — and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said 
Sirius. 



Page | 141Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, 
bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 
“Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his 
mother’s heart — ” 

“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius 
snapped. “She kept herself alive out of pure spite.” 

Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master 
says,” then muttered furiously, “Master is not fit to 
wipe slime from his mother’s boots, oh my poor 
Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher 
serving him, how she hated him, what a 
disappointment he was — ” 

“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. 
“Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, 
you sneak something off to your room so we can’t 
throw it out.” 

“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper 
place in Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered 
very fast, “Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if 
the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been 
in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not 
let Master and the blood traitors and the brats 
destroy it — ” 

“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a 
disdainful look at the opposite wall. “She’ll have put 
another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, 

I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. 
Now go away, Kreacher.” 

It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct 
order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he 
shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest loathing 
and he muttered all the way out of the room. 



Page | 142Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ — comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher 
around, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if 
she saw the house now, scum living in it, her 
treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of 
hers and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too — ” 

“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius 
irritably, and he slammed the door shut on the elf. 

“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione 
pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear 
him.” 

“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad 
orders from my mother’s portrait and talking to 
himself, but he was always a foul little — ” 

“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, 
“maybe — ” 

“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the 
Order,” said Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shock 
would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this 
house, see how he takes it.” 

Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry 
Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length 
of the wall. Harry and the others followed. 

The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and 
looked as though doxies had gnawed it in places; 
nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was 
embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show 
them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as 
Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at 
the very top of the tapestry read: 

THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK 



Page | 143Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“TOUJOURS PUR” 



“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the 
bottom of the tree. 

“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, 
round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a 
cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother blasted me off 
after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of 
muttering the story under his breath.” 

“You ran away from home?” 

“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had 
enough.” 

“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him. 

“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents 
were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a 
second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad’s during 
the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I 
got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me 
a decent bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, 
that’s probably why — anyway, after that I looked 
after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. 
Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.” 

“But . . . why did you ... ?” 

“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand 
through his long, unkempt hair. “Because I hated the 
whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood 
mania, convinced that to be a Black made you 
practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to 
believe them ... that’s him.” 



Page | 144Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, 
at the name REGULUS BLACK. A date of death (some 
fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth. 

“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much 
better son, as I was constantly reminded.” 

“But he died,” said Harry. 

“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot ... he joined the 
Death Eaters.” 

“You’re kidding!” 

“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this 
house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?” 
said Sirius testily. 

“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?” 

“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had 
the right idea, they were all for the purification of the 
Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and 
having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone 
either, there were quite a few people, before 
Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he 
had the right idea about things... They got cold feet 
when they saw what he was prepared to do to get 
power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus 
was a right little hero for joining up at first.” 

“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively. 

“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by 
Voldemort. Or on Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I 
doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed 
by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after 
he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he 
was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you 
Page | 145Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




don’t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It’s 
a lifetime of service or death.” 

“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice. 

She was holding her wand high in front of her, 
balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and 
cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still 
looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for 
some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had 
bent closer to the tapestry. 

“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas 
Nigellus ... my great-great-grandfather, see? Least 
popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had . . . and 
Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to 
force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting 
legal . . . and dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the 
family tradition of beheading house-elves when they 
got too old to carry tea trays ... of course, anytime the 
family produced someone halfway decent they were 
disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. Maybe that’s why 
Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed 
to do whatever anyone in the family asks him...” 

“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised. 

“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite 
cousin,” said Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. 
“No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look — ” 

He pointed to another small round burn mark 
between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa. 

“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made 
lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but 
Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so — ” 



Page | 146Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and 
laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was 
too busy staring at the names to the right of 
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold 
embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, 
and a single vertical gold line from their names led to 
the name Draco. 

“You’re related to the Malfoys!” 

“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said 
Sirius. “If you’re only going to let your sons and 
daughters marry purebloods your choice is very 
limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are 
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my 
second cousin once removed. But there’s no point 
looking for them on here — if ever a family was a 
bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.” 

But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of 
Andromeda’s burn: Bellatrix Black, which was 
connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange. 

“Lestrange ...” Harry said aloud. The name had 
stirred something in his memory; he knew it from 
somewhere, but for a moment he couldn’t think 
where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation 
in the pit of his stomach. 

“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly. 

Harry looked at him curiously. 

“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with 
Barty Crouch, Junior,” said Sirius in the same 
brusque voice. “Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was 
with them too.” 



Page | 147Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix 
Lestrange inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange 
device in which thoughts and memories could be 
stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, 
who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her 
continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride 
that she had tried to find him after his downfall and 
her conviction that she would one day be rewarded 
for her loyalty. 

“You never said she was your — ” 

“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. 
“As far as I’m concerned, they’re not my family. She’s 
certainly not my family. I haven’t seen her since I was 
your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in 
to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives 
like her?” 

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was 
just surprised, that’s all — ” 

“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at 
once. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands 
deep in his pockets. “I don’t like being back here,” he 
said, staring across the drawing room. “I never 
thought I’d be stuck in this house again.” 

Harry understood completely. He knew how he would 
feel if forced, when he was grown up and thought he 
was free of the place forever, to return and live at 
number four, Privet Drive. 

“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. 

“My father put every security measure known to 
Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s Unplottable, 
so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d 
have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his 
protection, you’d be hard put to find a safer house 
Page | 148Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the Order, 
you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he 
tells them personally where it is — that note Moody 
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore...” 
Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. “If my parents 
could see the use it was being put to now ... well, my 
mother’s portrait should give you some idea...” 

He scowled for a moment, then sighed. 

“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally 
and do something useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore 
whether I can escort you to your hearing — as 
Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral 
support, what d’you think?” 

Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through 
the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the 
hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the 
excitement of being back with the people he liked 
best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had 
completely flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, 
however, the crushing sense of dread returned to 
him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all 
tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he 
would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him. 

“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and 
realized that Sirius had been watching him. “I’m sure 
they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something 
in the International Statute of Secrecy about being 
allowed to use magic to save your own life.” 

“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I 
come back here and live with you?” 

Sirius smiled sadly. 

“We’ll see.” 

Page | 149Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t 
have to go back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him. 



“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said 
Sirius gloomily. 

“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” 
Mrs. Weasley called. 

Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at 
the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the 
others. 

Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing 
while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. 
Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of 
concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed 
very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius 
sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within 
seconds, his bitten hand had developed an 
unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. 

“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest 
before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring 
its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap powder in 
there.” 

He threw the box aside into the sack where they were 
depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw 
George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth 
moments later and sneak the box into his already 
doxy-filled pocket. 

They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, 
something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which 
scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked 
it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius 
seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a 
Page | 150Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling 
tune when wound, and they all found themselves 
becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had 
the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket 
that none of them could open, a number of ancient 
seals and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First 
Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather 
for “Services to the Ministry.” 

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius 
contemptuously, throwing the medal into the rubbish 
sack. 

Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and 
attempted to smuggle things away under his 
loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they 
caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden 
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher 
actually burst into furious tears and left the room 
sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names 
Harry had never heard before. 

“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring 
into the sack. “Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to 
him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging 
a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.” 

Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over 
the next few days. The drawing room took three days 
to decontaminate; finally the only undesirable things 
left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, 
which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the 
wall, and the rattling writing desk; Moody had not 
dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be 
sure what was inside it. 

They moved from the drawing room to a dining room 
on the ground floor where they found spiders large as 
saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room 

Page | 151Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for 
an hour and a half) . The china, which bore the Black 
crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into 
a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old 
photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose 
occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them 
smashed. 

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in 
Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the 
house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided 
and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept 
appearing wherever they were congregated, his 
muttering becoming more and more offensive as he 
attempted to remove anything he could from the 
rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him 
with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery 
stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,” 
before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but 
Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because 
Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is 
plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these 
Mudbloods and traitors and scum...” 

At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized 
Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him 
bodily from the room. 

The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the 
cue for Sirius’s mother to start shrieking again, and 
for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on 
the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the 
brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were 
able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to 
their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house 
several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never 
came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his 
Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, 



Page | 152Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though 
she also seemed too busy to linger. 

Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; 

Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in 
which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in 
an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the 
house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do 
mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a 
grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant 
habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby. 
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. 
Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of 
purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he 
removed them from their wardrobe. 

Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still 
having dreams about corridors and locked doors that 
made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have 
fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was 
busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, 
whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in 
bed watching blurred shadows move across the 
ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing 
returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like 
needles as he wondered what was going to happen to 
him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that 
he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and 
Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering 
together and casting anxious looks in his direction, 
followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes he 
could not prevent his imagination showing him a 
faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand 
in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ ... but 
he would not go. He was determined on that. He 
would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live 
with Sirius. 



Page | 153Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




He felt as though a brick had dropped into his 
stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during 
dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, “I’ve 
ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, 

Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. 

A good first impression can work wonders.” 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped 
talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and 
tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had 
become so dry he could not chew. 

“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, 
trying to sound unconcerned. 

“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. 
Weasley gently. 

Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the 
table. 

“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the 
hearing,” he said. 

Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask 
the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it. 

“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea 
for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I — ” 

“ — think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through 
clenched teeth. 

Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. 

“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, 
staring at Sirius. 



Page | 154Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. 
Weasley. 

Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. 
Harry dropped his own eyes to his plate. The thought 
that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of 
his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, 
if that were possible, even worse. 



Page | 155Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




7 




THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 

Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as 
abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in 
his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the 
prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his 
brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and 
put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his 
freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his 
bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on 
the wall sniggered again. 

Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth 
wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry 
crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and 
closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think 
of the next time he would see Ron, when they might 
no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry 
walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of 
Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen. 

He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When 
he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of 
voices on the other side and when he pushed it open 

Page | 156Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and 
Tonks sitting there almost as though they were 
waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. 
Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing 
gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. 

“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and 
hurried over to the fire. 

“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was 
blonde and curly this morning. “Sleep all right?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another 
shuddering yawn. “Come and sit down...” 

She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it 
in the process. 

“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. 
“Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? 

Toast?” 

“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry. 

Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What 
were you saying about Scrimgeour?” 

“Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, 
he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions...” 

Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to 
join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. 
Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and 
marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was 
like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his 
other side and started fussing with his T-shirt,

tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across 
the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t. 

"... and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night 
duty tomorrow, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, 
yawning hugely again. 

“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve 
got a report to finish anyway...” 

Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a 
pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. 
He turned from Tonks to Harry. 

“How are you feeling?” 

Harry shrugged. 

“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In 
a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared.” 

Harry said nothing. 

“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones ’s office. 
She’s Head of the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll be questioning 
you.” 

“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. 
“She’s fair, she’ll hear you out.” 

Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. 

“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be 
polite and stick to the facts.” 

Harry nodded again.

“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even 
underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life- 
threatening situations.” 

Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s 
neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting 
a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he 
realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with 
a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. 

“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately. 

Harry shook his head. 

Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at 
Harry. 

“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I 
think you’ll be better off there than hanging around 
here.” 

“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast 
and getting to his feet. 

“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on 
the arm. 

“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.” 

“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia 
Bones for you...” 

Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. 

“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said. 

“Right,” said Harry. “Well ... see you later then.”

He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. 
He could hear Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep 
behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door 
and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. 

“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry 
asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. 

“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but 
obviously you can’t, and I think it’s best we arrive in a 
thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better 
impression, given what you’re being disciplined for...” 

Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they 
walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. 
The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when 
they arrived at the miserable little Underground 
station they found it already full of early morning 
commuters. As ever when he found himself in close 
proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, 
Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. 

“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the 
automatic ticket machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.” 

“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the 
sign. 

“Yes, but even so ...” said Mr. Weasley, beaming 
fondly at them. 

They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy- 
looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. 
Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and 
five minutes later they were boarding an Underground 
train that rattled them off toward the center of 
London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and 
rechecking the Underground map above the windows. 



Page | 160Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Four stops, Harry ... three stops left now ... two 
stops to go, Harry ...” 

They got off at a station in the very heart of London, 
swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and 
women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they 
went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley 
delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), 
and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing- 
looking buildings, already full of traffic. 

“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for 
one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had 
gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley’s 
continual references to the map; but a second later he 
said, “Ah yes ... this way, Harry,” and led him down a 
side road. 

“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all 
looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a 
matter of fact I’ve never even used the visitor’s 
entrance before.” 

The farther they walked, the smaller and less 
imposing the buildings became, until finally they 
reached a street that contained several rather 
shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing 
dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more 
impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. 

“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at 
an old red telephone box, which was missing several 
panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied 
wall. “After you, Harry.” 

He opened the telephone box door. 

Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this 
was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry 

Page | 161Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was 
jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was 
hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal 
had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry 
for the receiver. 

“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” 
Harry said. 

“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding 
the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. 
“Let’s see ... six ...” he dialed the number, “two ... four 
... and another four ... and another two ...” 

As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool 
female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not 
from the receiver in Mr. Weasley’s hand, but as loudly 
and plainly as though an invisible woman were 
standing right beside them. 

“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your 
name and business.” 

“Er ...” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he 
should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised 
by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, “Arthur 
Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to 
escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a 
disciplinary hearing...” 

“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, 
please take the badge and attach it to the front of 
your robes.” 

There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw 
something slide out of the metal chute where 
returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It 
was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, 



Page | 162Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of 
his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. 

“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to 
a search and present your wand for registration at the 
security desk, which is located at the far end of the 
Atrium.” 

The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were 
sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched 
apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the 
glass windows of the telephone box until darkness 
closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at 
all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the 
telephone box made its way down through the earth. 
After about a minute, though it felt much longer to 
Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet 
and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in 
the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from 
watering. 

“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” 
said the woman’s voice. 

The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. 
Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose 
mouth had fallen open. 

They were standing at one end of a very long and 
splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. 
The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming 
golden symbols that were continually moving and 
changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. 
The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark 
wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. 
Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge 
from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft 
whoosh ; on the right-hand side, short queues of 



Page | 163Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to 
depart. 

Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of 
golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the 
middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a 
noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight 
up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful 
witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last 
three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and 
wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the 
ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur’s 
arrow, the tip of the goblin’s hat, and each of the 
house-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling 
water was added to the pops and cracks of 
Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of 
witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing 
glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of 
golden gates at the far end of the hall. 

“This way,” said Mr. Weasley. 

They joined the throng, wending their way between 
the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying 
tottering piles of parchment, others battered 
briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as 
they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw 
silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him 
from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign 
beside it read: 

All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will 
be given to 

St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries 

If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten 
Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. 



Page | 164Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they 
stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees 
heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the 
left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A 
badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up 
as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. 

“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing 
toward Harry. 

“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice. 

Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a 
long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and 
passed it up and down Harry’s front and back. 

“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting 
down the golden instrument and holding out his 
hand. 

Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto 
a strange brass instrument, which looked something 
like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to 
vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding 
out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and 
read the writing upon it. 

“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four 
years. That correct?” 

“Yes,” said Harry nervously. 

“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of 
parchment on a small brass spike. “You get this 
back,” he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. 

“Thank you.” 

“Hang on...” said the wizard slowly. 

Page | 165Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on 
Harry’s chest to his forehead. 

“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and 
grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away 
from the desk and back into the stream of wizards 
and witches walking through the golden gates. 

Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. 
Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall 
beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind 
wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined 
the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard 
holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box 
was emitting rasping noises. 

“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. 
Weasley. 

“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, 
looking at the box. 

“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We 
thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started 
breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban 
on Experimental Breeding to me.” 

With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in 
front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry 
and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the 
crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back 
wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were 
looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid 
catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did 
so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift 
ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while 
the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the 
telephone box rang out again. 



Page | 166Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and 
Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch 
League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and 
Ludicrous Patents Office.” 

The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy- 
looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch 
teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the 
wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of 
broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and 
disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the 
lift juddered upward again, and the woman’s voice 
said, “Level six, Department of Magical Transport, 
incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom 
Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation 
Test Center.” 

Once again the lift doors opened and four or five 
witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several 
paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up 
at them as they flapped idly around above his head; 
they were a pale violet color and he could see 
MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of 
their wings. 

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley 
muttered to him. “We used to use owls, but the mess 
was unbelievable ... droppings all over the desks ...” 

As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped 
around the swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling. 

“Level five, Department of International Magical 
Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical 
Trading Standards Body, the International Magical 
Office of Law, and the International Confederation of 
Wizards, British Seats.” 



Page | 167Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed 
out with a few more witches and wizards, but several 
more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the 
lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they 
darted around it. 

“Level four, Department for the Regulation and 
Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, 
Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and 
Pest Advisory Bureau.” 

“ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing 
chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of 
memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. 

“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and 
Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic 
Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and 
Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.” 

Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. 

Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an 
extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing 
on the ground. The remaining memos continued to 
soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward 
again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, 
“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror 
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration 
Services.” 

“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they 
followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined 
with doors. “My office is on the other side of the floor.” 

“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window 
through which sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we 
underground?” 



Page | 168Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted 
windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather 
we’re getting every day. We had two months of 
hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay 
raise... Just round here, Harry.” 

They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy 
oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area 
divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk 
and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of 
cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the 
nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS. 

Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as 
they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle 
walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards 
and photographs of their families, to posters of their 
favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily 
Prophet A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer 
than Bill’s was sitting with his boots up on his desk, 
dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a 
witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the 
top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they 
drew nearer. “I’ve been wanting a word with you, have 
you got a second?” 

“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in 
rather a hurry.” 

They were talking to each other as though they hardly 
knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth 
to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his 
foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into 
the very last cubicle. 

Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was 
blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper 

Page | 169Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




cuttings and old photographs — even the one of 
Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — 
papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a 
map of the world in which little red pins were glowing 
like jewels. 

“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, 
shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, “I need 
as much information as possible on flying Muggle 
vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve 
received information that Black might still be using 
his old motorcycle.” 

Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, 
in a whisper, “Give him the magazine, he might find it 
interesting.” Then he said in normal tones, “And don’t 
take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs 
report held our investigation up for a month.” 

“If you had read my report you would know that the 
term is ‘firearms,’ ” said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m 
afraid you’ll have to wait for information on 
motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He 
dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away 
before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” 

He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s 
cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into 
another passage, turned left, marched along another 
corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly 
shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, 
where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom 
cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished 
brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE 
ARTIFACTS. 

Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly 
smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had 
been crammed inside it and there was barely room to 

Page | 170Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




move around them because of all the overflowing 
filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were 
tottering piles of files. The little wall space available 
bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were 
several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled 
engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to 
have cut out of Muggle children’s books, and a 
diagram showing how to wire a plug. 

Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was 
an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate 
way and a pair of empty leather gloves that
